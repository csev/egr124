Welcome to 
<a href=http://www.vu.msu.edu/preview/egr124/>Internet and Technology</a>.  
This is a CD-ROM version of my on-line class.  
Som of the links are "live" and so it is best viewed on a system connected 
to the Internet so those links can be followed.
Because of the nature of a 
CD-ROM it will most likely be out of date.  To find the most up-to-date
material, please consult the URL at the bottom of this page.
Also, there are dynamic elements which are part of the on-line versions
of these lectures.
<ul>
<li><a href=overview/index.htm>The normal starting page for the class</a>
<li><a href=lectures/film/index.htm>A short film </a> 
<li><a href=lectures/index.htm>Lectures</a> 
<li><a href=multi/index.htm> Multimedia gallery </a>
<li><a href=help/index.htm> On-line Help </a>
<li><a href=overview/index.htm> About the class </a>
</ul>
