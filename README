Hello, this is the first CD/ROM of EGR124 (aka CPS291) at Michigan 
State University.  This is being developed as a demonstration of the 
technology used in the production of the class.  You should be able
to open the index.htm file in the root directory and voila.

This CDROM also contains a directory called doit which is the tool 
which I have developed to automate the process of making lectures.
the media, config files, are al in the directory.  If someone is interested
in collaborating using this software or interested in buying it, let me know.

It is not as easy for me to update this CDROM as it is to update a web page.
So, this CDROM will naturally be rather out-of date.  Web pages to look 
at include:

  http://www.egr.msu.edu/~crs/
  http://www.vu.msu.edu/preview/egr124/

This CD-ROM can be used for demos of the technology and by registered 
students in EGR124.  You are certainly NOT allowed to republish any of this 
material on the web without my permission.  (Duh!)

Please send me some feedback if you like this stuff.  By the time you
get this, I will have my really slick new format web pages up.
