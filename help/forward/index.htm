<h1>Changing Your Pilot Forwarding Address</h1>
<p>
If you regularly read E-Mail some other system than pilot, 
it is important to have your Pilot E-mail properly forwarded because 
official class mail is often sent to Pilot accounts only.
Off campus folks who do lookups on-line
using the web at http://www.msu.edu/user/  will find that address as well.
The administration also uses Pilot as their official place to mail 
notices to all MSU folks in times of crisis or other times.
<p>
Note that you can change your forwarding address as often as you like and
you can also remove the forwarding address to again keep your Pilot E-Mail
on Pilot.  
<p>
Here are my directions for getting your account forwarded properly.  
<ul>
<li> First send E-Mail to yourself at pilot.  For example, Ron Kraus 
would send E-Mail to kraus@pilot.msu.edu  If this mail shows up in a minute 
or two in your desired mailbox (such as AOL or Engineering) - 
you are done!  Quit now.  Your forwarding address is set properly.
<hr>
<li>If you have not yet activated your Pilot account, you need your ID and PIN
or PID and PAN.
Activate your Pilot account.  Note: If you are MichNet using dial-up, you must 
have activated your Pilot already and your Dial-up password is your 
Pilot password.
<hr>
<li>If you have your Pilot account and password, you can set your 
forwarding address.  First use 'telnet' to connect to Pilot.  
This can be done in the following ways:
<ul>
<li> On UNIX - <b> telnet pilot.msu.edu </b>
<li> On a PC using FTP Software - <b> tn pilot.msu.edu </b>
<li> On a PC Using Windows-95 - Start / Run / telnet pilot.msu.edu / "OK"
</ul>
Using Windows-95 your screen will look as follows:
<p>

<p>
Enter your Pilot ID and password.  Note: If you are doing Dial-up, you use 
your Pilot ID + "@msu.edu" (i.e. crs@msu.edu) - Don't include the "@msu.edu"
as your login name for Pilot. (As shown above)
<hr>
<li> Once you log in, you will see the Pilot Main Menu:
<p>

<p>
If you see "Your mail is being forwarded" and your desired account is
shown (as in the above example) log-out because you have nothing to 
do.
<hr>
<li>If you do not have a forwarding address set or the forwarding
address is not what you want, go to selection 
"a - Advanced Features" and it will look as follows:
<p>

<p>
Select the "f - Forwarding E-Mail" option and then select "c - Change" Option
<hr>
<li>At the Change E-mail screen:
<p>

<p>
Enter the E-Mail address where you want your mail to be sent
(i.e. kraus@egr.msu.edu or melvin123@aol.com ) 
and press enter.  Then quit out of each menu and exit Pilot.
<hr>
<li>As a final test, send E-Mail to your pilot ID (i.e. kraus@pilot.msu.edu ) 
and make sure that you get the message at the desired mailbox.
<hr>
<li>Congratulations - You are done

</ul>
