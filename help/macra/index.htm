<P>
<UL>
<LI>Go to <a 
href="http://www.realaudio.com/">http://www.realaudio.com/</a> and then 
click on free RealPlayer 4.0. 
<LI>When the next page comes up, click on RealPlayer and another page 
should come up. 
<LI>Here is where you have to fill in some information about your 
computer.  RealPlayer 4.0 is only available for PowerPC based Macintoshes.
If you have a 68040 with FPU based Macintosh, you will have to download 
RealAudio Player 3.0.
<LI>After you click on the "Download Now" button and the download sites 
page loads, click and hold on one of the sites.  Then select "Save this 
link as . . .".  Save the link to the Desktop by clicking on the Desktop 
button in the Save dialog box.  Save the link as source by selecting 
"Source" in the menu at the bottom.

<LI>You will download the file playerppc40.hqx if you have a PowerPC.  
This will have to be decoded by Stuffit Expander. To do this, double 
click on the icon and Stuffit Expander should automatically start up and 
expand it.  This option may be set in your browser so that as soon as 
it's completely downloaded Stuffit Expander is automatically launched.  If 
you don't have Stuffit Expander, you can 
get version 4.01  at <a href="http://www.jumbo.com">Jumbo Shareware</a>.

<LI>Stuffit Expander will leave the file "RealPlayer Installer on your 
desktop.  Double click this to begin the installation process. 
<em>NOTE:</em>  You will have to quit your web browser to continue.
<LI>During the installation, you will be asked several questions. 
Suggested responses are (much like the Windows version):
<UL>
<LI>Click "Next" Button twice
<LI>Fill in a name and company and click "Next" button
<LI>Select your Internet connection.
<LI>Select what folder to put it in.  Probably "RealPlayer" inside the 
"Macintosh HD" would be good.
<LI>Let it find the installed browsers and modify them if you want. Click 
"Next" to continue or "Finish" to actually install the software.
</UL>
<LI>Now Real Player runs a test to see if it works right.
<LI>Now, restart Netscape and try the EGR124 test again.
<LI>You can delete the "playerppc40.hqx" and "RealPlayer Installer" files 
if you wish.
<LI>If you want to get rid of this software, drag the "RealPlayer" folder 
to the trash and delete it.  Also drag it's preferences file from the 
"Preferences" folder in the "System Folder" to the trash and delete that, 
too.  You may want to do a "Find" to see if there are any other files left 
lying around your hard drive.
