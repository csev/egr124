<h1>How to view EGR124 Over AOL??</h1>
<p>
The most important thing to make EGR124 viewable over AOL is to download
"AOL 3.0 For Windows-95".  Check under "Help" and "About America-Online" - it
must say "America Online 3.0 for Windows-95".  It if says, "America Online
3.0 for Windows" that is not enough.  To upgrade to AOL 3.0 for Windows-95
go to keyword (CRTL-K) AOL30 and follow instructions.  
The download will take about 2 hours but
you will get a new AOL with a JAVA capable browser, RealAudio, Microsoft
Internet Explorer, WINSOCK, a telnet client, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
<p>
The download is about 11 Megabytes but once you are done, your AOL connection
will be as functional as any ISP connection.  This is a significant improvement
on AOL.  After you upgrade you might find that you prefer to sign on to AOL,
minimize it and then start Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape 
and do the class  using one of those browsers instead of AOL.  As a matter
of fact I am typiing this documentation using standard Windows-95 
telnet through AOL!.
<p>
If you don't upgrade, you will need to get WINSOCK working 
(Go winsock on AOL) and make sure to get 16 bit 
versions of all the players or they won't work.  History has shown that this
is VERY dfficult to get working so stick with AOL 3.0 for Windows-95.
<p>
Once you have installed 3.0 for Windows-95, you should go to the test area 
and RealAudio should work right out of the box.  RealVideo
will need to be reinstalled after upgrading to AOL.
<p>
You should do the following steps:
<ul>
<li> Upgrade to AOL 3.0 for Windows-95
<li>JAVA should work immediately 
<li>Real Audio should work in Download-then-play and Streaming 
<li> If you have a 486DX2-66 or better then install RealPlayer 4.0 according to 
the instructions at:
<a href=http://www.vu.msu.edu/preview/egr124/test/realplayer4/>
http://www.vu.msu.edu/preview/egr124/test/realplayer4/
</a> - It should automatically find AOL and set itself up
when it searches for browsers.
After is installs go back and test - all forms of audio and video should now
work.
</ul>
<p>
You may have to uninstall RealAudio or RealPlayer
before you start this process.
See the <a href=../uninstall/index.htm> Uninstalling Software from Windows-95 </a> 
documentation for details.
<p>
When you use Synchronized slides in the lectures, they will appear in 
a separate Internet Explorer or Netscape windows rather than inside AOL. As a 
matter of fact, you might be better off to sign on to AOL, minimize it, 
then run Netscape of Internet Explorer for the class.  Because 
Internet Explorer comes with AOL 3.0 for Windows-95, this is quite easy.
<p>
Note - If you are doing any of the tests on the EGR124
<a href=../../test/index.htm> test page </a> and see the following screen:

<p>
it means that you have not completed the installations above properly.  Exit
AOL and re-install either RealAudio, or RealVideo.  If you are brave
and believe you have installed the players properly, you can select, "Open
it" and find the appropriate browser for the file type.  But the safe bet is
to reinstall (or install) the viewer software and have it 
automtically configure AOL.
<p>
If <i> anyone </i> can help improve these instructions, please let me know.
I don't have a lot of skills in America Online.
