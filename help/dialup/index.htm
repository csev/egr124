<P>4. &nbsp;You should then see the following window. &nbsp;Your modem
should already be displayed in the &quot;Select a modem:&quot; space. &nbsp;If
it is not click on the triangle to the left and highlight your modem.&nbsp;
If your modem still is not listed you may not have your modem set up. &nbsp;You
must do this first. &nbsp;See your modem's, and Windows 95's instructions
on how to setup your modem. &nbsp;When you are done click &quot;Next.&quot;<BR>

5.&nbsp; Type in the number for your local <A href="http://www.merit.edu/michnet/phonenos/michnet.nos">MichNet
access number</A> or your service provider and click on the triangle to
select your country. &nbsp;Now click &quot;Next.&quot;<BR>

<P>6. &nbsp;Now click on &quot;Finish&quot; and you are ready to go. &nbsp;When
you start up Netscape the automatic dialer should start up. &nbsp;If it
doesn't you can always click on &quot;My Computer&quot; and then click
on Dial-Up Networking (same as step 1 and 2). &nbsp;You should see the
connection you just made. &nbsp;Click on it to connect to MichNet. &nbsp;You
should see the window below.</P>

<P>7. &nbsp;Type in your pilot user name with the @msu attached at the
end like in the image to the left. &nbsp;The password is also the same
as your pilot password. &nbsp;If you are not using MichNet you will use
your user name and password that your service provider gives you, and you
may be required to do additional setup procedures. &nbsp;Check with the
documentation your provider sent. &nbsp;The phone number displayed should
be the same number as you used to create the connection earlier.&nbsp;Next
you need to click on the &quot;Dial Properties...&quot; button, and the
window below should appear.</P>

8. &nbsp;You may want to change the name of the location you are dialing
from, especially if you will be taking your computer back to East Lansing
This Fall, otherwise you can use the default name. &nbsp;To create a new
location, click on &quot;New&quot; and enter a name. &nbsp;Next, type in
the area code for this location. &nbsp;Now fill out the rest of the areas
that apply to you. &nbsp;About call waiting, if you do have calling waiting
it is important to disable it before dialing up to MichNet. &nbsp;If call
waiting is left on and another call comes in while you are online you will
lose the connection. &nbsp;To disable call waiting, click on the triangle
and select the appropriate code for your area. &nbsp;If you are unsure
what code to use check a local phone book or contact your operator. &nbsp;If
you are choosing to call an access number which is long distance check
to see if there is a local access number. &nbsp;If not, you may want to
consider using a service provider who does have a local access number since
the cost of connecting to a service might be cheaper than paying long distance
rates.</P>
