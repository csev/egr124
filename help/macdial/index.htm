<center><H1>How to Set Up a MacOS Computer to Make a PPP Connection Via 
Modem</H1></center> <P>
In MacOS computers with System 7.5 and above, there are three control 
panels that you need to configure: PPP, TCP/IP, and Appletalk.
<ul>
<li>If you have your printer connected with an AppleTalk network, you 
will need to locate the Appletalk Control Panel.  This is in Control 
Panels under the Apple Menu in the upper left corner of the screen.
<li>Set the appletalk port to the port that does not have the modem in it.
<li>If you do not need AppleTalk active, go to Chooser under the Apple 
Menu.  Select Inactive for Appletalk and close the window.
<br>

<li>Locate the PPP Control Panel.  It is in the same place as the 
AppleTalk Control Panel.  
<li>Set up the PPP Control Panel.

<ul>
<li>Click "Registered User".  For an MSU Pilot ID, this is smithr5@msu.edu
where "smithr5 is your Pilot ID.
<li>Fill in your password.  (For MSU use the Pilot password)
<li>If your computer is in a secure location where people won't abuse 
your account, click "Save Password".
<li>Fill in the phone number that you need to dial, with all area codes 
and numbers needed to reach "outside" lines.  To use the Merit Network, see
<a href=http://www.merit.edu/phonenos/michnet-nos.html>
http://www.merit.edu/phonenos/michnet-nos.html
</a> to look up a phone number in your area.
</ul>
<li>Click "Options".
<ul>
<li>If you want the dialler to redial the number, set the redial option 
to your liking.<br>

Control Panel.">
<li>Click the "Connections" tab.
<li>You might want to click the "Connect automatically . . . TCP/IP 
applications" because that would allow you to just double-click Netscape 
or Telnet to have your modem dialled.
<br>
<iimg src="options2.gif"><br>
<li>Click on the "Protocols" tab.
<li>The defaults here should be fine.  But you may want to know what's 
here for future reference.

</ul>
<li>Close the window and close PPP.  Remember to save the settings.
<li>Now go to the TCP/IP Control Panel.  It is in the same place as 
AppleTalk and PPP.
<li>Select "PPP" where it says "Connect via:".
<img src="tcpip2.gif"><br>
<li>Then select "Using PPP Server" where it says "Configure".
<li>The next thing you need to do is fill in your "Name Server Address" 
and "Search Domains".  This information would have to come from your ISP.
For MSU users with merit, use 35.8.2.41 for the name server and msu.edu
for the search domain.
</ul>
<P>
If you have MacOS 8, you can set this up when you install the system.  
You can also go through the Internet setup helper at any time.  Just use 
"Connect To..." Under the Apple Menu.  There will be several questions to 
answer and fields to fill in.  The program will do all of the above 
changes for you.
