<h2>How to Make Audio/Video Stream in AOL</h2>
<p>
If you upgrade to <a href=../aol/index.htm> AOL 3.0 for Windows-95 </a> making 
this stuff work becomes much easier.
<p>
If you insist on making this work on AOL 2.5 or AOL 3.0 for Windows, you 
will first have to install WINSOCK for AOL (keyword WINSOCK), then find 16-bit
versions or Netscape, RealAudio, RealPlayer, and Quicktime.
<p>
Once you have all that software installed, you need to set the preferences
in the AOL WWW browser.
<ul>
<li>Go to Members | Set Preferences
<p>

<p>
You may want to use "Browse" to find the player just to make sure that you 
really have found it.
<li>If you are using RealAudio, the last field should be <b> C:\raplayer\raplayer.exe </b>
<li>If you are using RealVideo, the last field should be <b> C:\real\player\rvplayer.exe </b>
<li> Press OK | Close | OK  and then close the "Preferences" windows
<li> You should be good to go!
</ul>
