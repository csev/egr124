<h1>Installing Quicktime - EGR124</h1>
<p>
This is the step by step procedure for installing Quicktime
<a href=http://www.vu.msu.edu/egr124/> EGR124 - Introduction to the Internet
</a>.
<p>
Macintosh systems usually come with Quicktime already installed but you may
want to upgrade your Quicktime.
<p>
You may want to print out these instructions before starting.
<ul>
<li>Download the Quicktime by clicking 
<a href="http://quicktime.apple.com/sw/qtwin32.html">
here.
</a>
Select "QuickTime Easy Install".
<p>
Where you save the downloaded information is important.  Go to the C:\ 
directory by clicking the "move up a level" one or more times.

<li>
If you have a <b> C:\temp </b> directory, skip this step.
Once you have reached C:, create a directory called <b> temp </b> by clicking 
on the "Make New Directory" button.  The directory name will initially be 
"New Folder" and the name will be highlighted so just type <b> temp </b> and 
<li>
Then click to enter the <b> temp </b> folder to enter the <b> C:\temp </b>
folder and click on "Save".
<li> After the file has downloaded, exit Netscape or MS-Explorer.
The installation will reconfigure your browser so it cannot be running.
<li> Click on "My Computer" on your desk top.  Click on "C:".  Click on the
"Temp" folder.  You should see the file you just downloaded.
<li>Begin the installation by clicking on the downloaded file <b>
qteasy.exe</b>
<li>During the installation you will be asked the following questions:
<ul>
<li>It will ask if you want to install Quicktime and the Plug-in - Say "Yes"
<li>It will say Welcome - "Next"
<li> If it asks you would like to reinstall Quicktime - say "Yes"
<li>License terms - "Agree"
<li>Do you want to install? - "Install"
<li>Go ahead and scan for exsiting versions of Quicktime - "Start"
<li>If it finds another Quicktime - Delete it - Quicktime has an anoying
habit of scattering stuff all over your hard disk.  Oh well.
<li>Once the scan is done, click "Install"
<li>Any strange questions which come up - Just say "OK"
<li>When it says, "Updating .INI files", think to yourself - "Who was the moron
who could not do a standard Windows-95 installation?"  You don't need
to type or click at this point.
<li>When it says "Install Complete" - "OK" (It is not really done though)
<li>After some flashing, it will come back with another license 
agreement - "Yes"
<li>Select your browser - "Next"
<li>If it asks you about searching a network drive - say "No" unless that
is really where you have your browser stored.
<li>It will ask where to install the plugin.  
"C:\...\Navigator\plugins" is just fine - "Next" - Note - It really means to 
say "C:\Program Files\Netscape\Navigator\plugins" in case you were interested.
<li>The nifty bar graphs will bounce up and down and it will ask you to 
press "Finish" - so do it.
</ul>
<li>At this point, restart Netscape and try the EGR124 test again :)
<li>You may delete the downloaded files <b> qteasy32.exe </b> in the C:\temp directory
<li>If you want to remove this software, go to "Start" / "Settings" / "Control
Panel" / "Add/Remove Programs".  Find the software name in the list at the 
bottom of the Add/Remove Programs Dialog, select the software and click
"Add/Remove".
</ul>
