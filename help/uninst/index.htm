<P>This page is designed to show a user how to use the built in uninstall
feature in Windows 95.</P>

<P>In the following example I am uninstalling RealAudio from my computer,
because I am upgrading to RealPlayer. &nbsp;It is my experience that it
is best to uninstall an old program before you upgrade to a new one. &nbsp;This
is because it eliminates problems you may encounter if you later try to
uninstall the old program. &nbsp;Sometimes parts of the new program are
also removed if two programs are just different versions of the same thing.
&nbsp;The first step is to left mouse click on the &quot;Start&quot; button
in you screens lower left-hand corner. &nbsp;A menu will pop up like you
see in the image to the right. &nbsp;Move the mouse pointer up to &quot;settings&quot;
and another menu pops up. &nbsp;Go over to &quot;Control Panel&quot; and
left mouse click on it. &nbsp;The window below will come up.<BR>
</P>

</P>

<P>The window that you see on your computer screen should be very similar
to the image on the left. &nbsp;Now locate the &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot;
icon, which is the highlighted icon in the image to the left. &nbsp;Double
click on this icon with your left mouse button. &nbsp;Your computer should
now display the window below.<BR>

</P>

<P>Next, go to the &quot;Install/Uninstall&quot; tab at the top of the
window. &nbsp;Scroll down until you find the program you are interested
in uninstalling from your computer. &nbsp;In this example it is RealAudio
Player 3.0. &nbsp;Now highlight the correct program by left mouse clicking
on it. &nbsp;Now move the mouse pointer down to the &quot;Add/Remove...&quot;
button like the image to the right shows and left click on it. &nbsp;If
you can not find the program you wish to uninstall, then Windows 95 must
not be able to uninstall it. &nbsp;Look in the instructions for the program
for proper removal procedures, or on the original disk for an uninstall
program. &nbsp;If you still can not find a way to uninstall the program
either leave it, or delete the files manually.<BR>

</P>

<P>If you found the program to uninstall and clicked the &quot;Add/Remove...&quot;
button, then the window to the left should pop up. &nbsp;Click on &quot;OK&quot;
and Windows 95 will begin removing the program.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="uninst5.gif" HEIGHT=140 WIDTH=339 ALIGN=RIGHT> <BR>
</P>

<P>When Windows 95 is done removing the program the window to the right
will show up. &nbsp;Click the &quot;OK&quot; button and you are done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

</P>

<P>If you want, you can check and make sure the program is gone. &nbsp;As
you can see by the image to the left, the program is no longer listed.
&nbsp;For some programs, Windows 95 will not be able to uninstall all or
any of the program. &nbsp;If during the uninstalling process Windows 95
informs you that it can not remove all of the directories or files associated
with a program you may want to manually remove them yourself. &nbsp;Be
careful when deleting files that you are removing the correct files, and
not things that may be needed. &nbsp;If you do accidentally remove a file
that you need, check the &quot;Recycle Bin&quot; icon and restore the file.</P>
