<h1>Installing RealPlayer 4.0 - EGR124</h1>
<p>
This is the step by step procedure for installing RealPlayer 4.0 for 
<a href=http://www.vu.msu.edu/egr124/> EGR124 - Introduction to the Internet
</a>.
If you have a Pentium, or Macintosh
use RealPlayer 4.0 or higher so it can do Audio and Video with a single player.
If you have a 486, use RealAudio 2.0.
<p>
You may want to print out these instructions before starting.
Note - these instructions are Windows-o-centric.  If someome wants to develop
a Mac-o-centric version - I will put it up here.
<ul>
<li>Download the RealPlayer 4.0 by clicking 
<a href="http://www.real.com/products/player/download.html">
here
</a>
and following instructions requesting the "RealPlayer 4.0 Beta 1".
You will have to fill in your system information, name and E-mail address.
<p>
When you start to download the file, you will be prompted as to where
to save the information.
Where you save the downloaded information is important.  Go to the C:\ 
directory by clicking the "move up a level" one or more times.

<li>
If you have a <b> C:\temp </b> directory, skip this step.
Once you have reached C:, create a directory called <b> temp </b> by clicking 
on the "Make New Directory" button.  The directory name will initially be 
"New Folder" and the name will be highlighted so just type <b> temp </b> and 
<li>
Then click to enter the <b> temp </b> folder to enter the <b> C:\temp </b>
folder and click on "Save".
<li> After the file has downloaded, exit Netscape or MS-Explorer.
The installation will reconfigure your browser so it cannot be running.
<li> Click on "My Computer" on your desk top.  Click on "C:".  Click on the
"Temp" folder.  You should see the file you just downloaded.
<li>Begin the installation by clicking on the downloaded file <b>
rp32_4b1.exe</b>
<li>During the installation you will be asked the following questions:
<ul>
<li>Click - "Next" twice
<li>Fill in your name and company - "Continue" / "OK"
<li>Select your Internet Connection - "28.8" is fine
<li>Which Directory? - "C:\Real\Player" is fine - Click "Next"
<li>Let it search for the installed Browsers - When it finds them click "Next"
<li>Click "Finish" to begin the actual installation.
<li>Any strange questions which come up about old or new DLL's - 
    Just say "Keep Newer Version" - This happens when you install and 
    re-install lots of Windows Software
</ul>
<li>RealAudio will run a test to see if it works properly
<li>At this point, restart Netscape and try the EGR124 test again :)
<li>You may delete the downloaded file
<b>rp32_4b1.exe</b>
from the C:\temp directory
<li>If you want to remove this software, go to "Start" / "Settings" / "Control
Panel" / "Add/Remove Programs".  Find the software name in the list at the
bottom of the Add/Remove Programs Dialog, select the software and click
"Add/Remove".
