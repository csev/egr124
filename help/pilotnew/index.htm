In order to activate your Pilot ID using these instructions, you must have the
following:
<ul>
<li>A working internet connection
<li>Your identification numbers issued by Michigan State:
<ul>
<li> Student: PID                          A08282827 PAN: 8821
<li> Faculty/Staff: Social Security Number 929288371 PIN: 8817
</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Steps to Activating Pilot</h2>
<p>
First you must run telnet to connect to the pilot system.  
This can be done in the following ways:
<ul>
<li> On UNIX - <b> telnet pilot.msu.edu </b>
<li> On a PC using FTP Software - <b> tn pilot.msu.edu </b>
<li> On a PC Using Windows-95 - Start / Run / telnet pilot.msu.edu / "OK"
<li> On a well-configured web browser, click <a href=telnet://pilot.msu.edu>
here </a>
</ul>
<p>
At the login: prompt enter pilot.   No password is required so just press 
the "Enter" key.

Then you will be prompted for your PID/SSN and PAN.  The PAN will 
not appear when typed.

You will then be prompted to set a password on your new Pilot account as
follows:

Once you have set your password (make sure to remember it!) you will see a 
screen which looks as follows:

<p>
After you press enter, you will be connected to Pilot to log in.
<p>
You may want to set up your <a href=../forward>forwarding address</a>
in Pilot if you already have an E-Mail account.  
<p>
You can go through this process again if you forget the password but still
have your PID and PAN.
<p>
Using the Pilot ID you can now enter the password protected portions of the
class.
