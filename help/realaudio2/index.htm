This is the step by step procedure for installing RealAudio 2.0 for

RealAudio 2.0 is needed when you have a 486 system.   If you have a Pentium, 
or Macintosh
use RealPlayer 3.0 or higher so it can do Audio and Video with a single player.

You may want to print out these instructions before starting.
<ul>
<li>Download the RealAudio 2.0 by clicking

You may have to "Right click" and "Save as" if our browser tries to execute
the program automatically.
Where you save the downloaded information is important.  Go to the C:\ 
directory by clicking the "move up a level"

<li>Realaudio Player Successfully Installed - "OK"

<li>At this point, restart Netscape and try the EGR124 test again :)
