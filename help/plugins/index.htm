the size of your Netscape window)</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>This page is designed to help people who have downloaded QuickTime,
Realaudio, or Realplayer, but still are having problems with them either
working at all, or automatically starting up from Netscape (i.e. Netscape
doesn't require you to save the file then run it from Windows.) </P>

<P><IMG SRC="netsc1.gif" HEIGHT=192 WIDTH=390 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P>I will start with QuickTime since when I downloaded it the installation
did not set Netscape up so that QuickTime would run when I clicked on a
QuickTime file. &nbsp;First go to &quot;Options&quot; and click on &quot;General
Preferences&quot; like this first image illustrates. &nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="netsc7.gif" HEIGHT=440 WIDTH=506 ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>You should now see something like the image to the left. &nbsp;Click
on the &quot;Helpers&quot; tab at the top, and scroll down until you see
the &quot;video/quicktime&quot; position, which is also highlighted to
the left. &nbsp;If your window also doesn't have Play32.exe displayed as
the program to run for a QuickTime movie like the images to the left, then
click on the circle to the left of &quot;Launch the Application:&quot;
and then click the &quot;Browse&quot; button.&nbsp;</P>

<P><BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="netsc2.gif" HEIGHT=264 WIDTH=426 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P>The Window to the right should pop up. &nbsp;You need to find the Play32.exe
file. &nbsp;It should be located in your &quot;Windows&quot; directory.
&nbsp;To get to it, click on the triangle next to the &quot;Look in&quot;
section of the window like the image to the right suggests. &nbsp;Now click
on the Windows95 (C:) icon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="netsc3.gif" HEIGHT=264 WIDTH=426 ALIGN=LEFT></P>

<P>Now find the &quot;Windows&quot; directory and click on it. &nbsp;Scroll
until you find the &quot;Play32.exe&quot; file and double click on it.
&nbsp;If the file is not in this directory make sure you did install QuickTime
after you downloaded it. &nbsp;If you are sure you did install it, then
maybe install put the program in a different location than this. &nbsp;Use
Windows &quot;Find&quot; utility to locate the file and use the procedures
above to go to the directory &quot;Find&quot; tells you the file is in.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<P><IMG SRC="netsc4.gif" HEIGHT=440 WIDTH=506 ALIGN=RIGHT></P>

<P>If you successfully found the file and clicked on it, then the window
that appears should look like the image to the right. &nbsp;Make sure the
&quot;Launch the Application:&quot; circle is marked and hit &quot;OK.&quot;
&nbsp;If you want you can go to the <A href="http://egr124.vu.msu.edu/701/test/">CPS
291 Test Page</A>, and try it out.</P>

For RealPlayer make sure that you have the same setting as in the highlighted
sections in the next two windows to the left. &nbsp;If you don't, use
similar procedures as described above for the QuickTime example. &nbsp;The
program should be at the following location: &nbsp;C:\Real\Player\rvplayer.exe.
&nbsp;If you are using Realaudio instead of RealPlayer, then ware you see
rvplayer in the two windows to the right, you should see raplayer. &nbsp;It
will be located at: &nbsp;C:\Real\Player\raplayer.exe.&nbsp;</P>

<P>Good Luck!!!</P>
