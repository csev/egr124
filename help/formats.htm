s/@TITLE@/Different Lecture Formats and Delivery/
-->
<p>
The lectures can in this course can be delivered in one of two different 
formats and using one of four different types of delivery.  One 
will work for you depending on your connection speed and screen size.
If you are having trouble with one format, you might have better luck
with another format or delivery mechanism.
First I will discuss the different formats.  
<p>
<img src=fmtplug.gif border=0 align=left>
<h2>Plug-In Format</H2>
The preferred format uses the
realplayer plug-in so the entire lecture is displayed on a Netscape screen.
This allows the user to randomly jump around using the on-screen media index
quite nicely.  This is also good for small screens such as 640x480. 
On a larger screen I tend to use this format with a tall narrow 
viewer so I can se thew notes page at the bottom without
using up all of my 17" monitor.
Because
of the limitations of relative path names on CD-ROM, this is the only format 
available for CD-ROM version of a lecture.

<h2>Separate Viewer</H2>
In this format, the Realplayer viewer is executed separately but still controls
the Netscape browser window advancing the slides where appropriate. This is a nice format if you have a really large screen.  It is nice to have all 
of the player controls available, and you can set the view to be "auto-sizing" and end up with almost the same look as the plug-in view by
carefully arranging the windows.
With this format, the media index is not too useful.  (I could make the 
media index work but then I would need a separate media index 
for each format. Whew more software!) 
For now, the best way to jump around the lecture is 
to use the slider bar on the player.
<h2>Delivery Mechanisms</h2>
There are four different ways that the audio/video can be delivered from 
this class.  Each has advantages and disadvantages.  I will cover each in turn.
<ul>
<li> <b> CD-ROM or Hard-Disk </b>  - This has the advantage that it is fast and 
you don't need a network connection to view the lectures.  It requires the use 
of the plug-in format because of problems with relative path names and separate viewers.  The disadvantage is that I bet you don't have a copy of 
the lectures on CD-ROM! :(  
One of these days I <i>will</I> begin the manufacture of the CD-ROM
version of the course. (When I get caught up with those other things)
<li> <b> Streaming </b> - This can be used with either the plug-in or separate
viewer.  Streaming uses a special protocol (pnm:) between your computer and
and the VU server.  This has a number of advantages:  (1) It alows quick 
random access, (2) it can sense and adapt to different network conditions, 
and (3) when things are working well you can use your connection to do other
work.  Its disadvantage is that it is a special protocol.  If you are behind
a firewall you might not be able to pass that protocol through the firewall.
Sometimes when you have a flaky connection it can get confused and spend 
too much time re-adjusting itself.
<li> <b> Pseudo-Streaming </b> - This technique does not use its own protocol.
The data is all retrieved through a standard TCP/IP port 80 connection (http:).
If you can surf the web, then this will often pass through a firewall.  Some
configuration may be required on the separate viewer if you have a firewall.  This approach does not adapt to different network conditions.  Once the lecture
is started, the player tries to download the entire lecture to disk as fast 
as it can.  Once it has a few seconds ahead it starts playing the video 
or audio.  As long as the material is downloading faster than it is 
being played there will be no stpoppages.  If the download is too slow the 
play will catch up and pause while it downloads some more.  If you 
jump ahead you will cause a very long pause while it downloads all 
the skipped data.  However when you can jump <i>backwards</i> there will be
no pasues (because 
that part is on disk).  If you want to do something else while 
it is downloading it might be sluggish because pseudo-streaming uses all
the bandwidth it can until it has all the data on the disk.  The 
other disadvantage is that you will need sufficient free disk space 
to store the entire 1-4MB lecture while it is playing.
If you play RealAudio 3.0 or lower 
files using this technique across the net, the slide
flips will NOT work.  RealAudio 5.0  and all versions of video 
files will flip the slides using the separate viewer.
At times I have found pseudo-streaming to be more realiable than streaming 
on a poor network connection.  That is because pseudo-streaming can 
get "farther ahead" when the network is working OK so it can tolerate longer 
network "hiccups".
<li> <b>Download</b> - This format is the absolute most basic format.  
It downloads the entire 1-4MB lecture to disk before it even starts playing.  
Then the separate viewer is called to play the file from disk.  
You can jump around quite nicely using the slider bar because it is all on 
disk.  This format will work through a firewall.  This format will even
allow you to view a video (normally 28.8 modem or faster) on a slow modem.
It will take about 20 minutes to download a 10 minute lecture but once it is 
downloaded and starts to play, it will play fine and assuming RealAudio 5.0
or and Video
media, slides will flip just fine.  It will NOT play at all while downloading.
You will need to have enough hard disk to store the entire lecture as it
will be completely stored on disk before the lecture starts.
This format will be patient and work on almost all but the 
cruddiest network connections.
</ul>
In general, I would try the formats in the order listed.  The plug-in with
streaming is great with the thumbnails and javascript butons.  However if
your infrastructure is not up to it, the other formats provide a usable 
envirnment.
