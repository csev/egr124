In 1997, it is dangerous to assume that the Internet is the way  that it will be forever.  The “Internet” is here to stay but the way we use it, how well it works, and how we pay for it are all in a state of flux.
<BR></UL><UL>
To appreciate the challenge in making the Internet work, imagine that there were no telephone network.  We all have hand-held radios with a 10 mile range and a few people have radios which can reach across the country but only to five places around the country.  Try to get a message from East Lansing, Michigan to Palo Alto California in six hundredths of a second and back.</UL> </P>
