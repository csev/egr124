The Internet is nearly as pervasive outside the US as inside the US. There are a number of factors which make the Internet different outside the US. Most importantly, the governments of other countries are much more involved in the telephone companies. Further, in Europe, many countries develop similar approaches using International Standards ( <a href=http://www.iso.org>www.iso.org</a> ). These standards are developed through a long formal process. the Internet standards (TCP/IP) are developed in a much more informal manner (www.ietf.org ).

Throughout the 1970’s, 1980’s and early 1990’s the European countries pushed a packet switching networking technology called X.25. This was supplied through the phone companies. It was slow and expensive and did not really catch on with end-users. During that same period, the Internet was being developed using telephone lines but the actual Internet was under control of the National Science Foundation and a number of universities.

However, as the Universities in the US began to use the Internet more and more, the European and Japanese Universities began to use TCP/IP and the Internet. In the last 4-5 years as the Internet has been adopted by end-users, the infrastructure was already in place in the European and Japanese Universities. Because the phone systems and modems are completely compatible, Internet access is roughly uniform around the world.

Because of the historical power of the phone companies, the Internet may be deployed more “cleanly” in Europe. Japan also seems to be willing to allow the phone companies to participate in the Internet  development in that country.</UL> </P>
