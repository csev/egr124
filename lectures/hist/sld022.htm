Gopher was rapidly adopted.  In a short time, gopher servers, gopher clients, gopher conferences, gopher working groups, and gopher content were developed and deployed.  Of course there was no charge for any of the software which feuled this growth.  At the peak of gopher popularity, University of Minnesota decided to make some revenue off of Gopher’s success.  The resulting confusion meant that when the free web software arrived, gopher was powerless.
