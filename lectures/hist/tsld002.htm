While the Internet appears to have popped up on the technology radar screen in the last year or so, it is over 35 years old.  In a sense Universities and research organizations slowly developed the Internet for 30 years in preparation for its formal introduction to mass society in 1992.  During the first 30 years the Internet was not viewed as a “product”.  There was little thought given to marketing the Internet.  The effort was focused on just making the Internet work.  However, by 1992, the Internet was a very mature and successful method to tie computers around the country together.  All it needed was a little shove into the spotlight and few million dollars worth of high-speed phone line upgrades to become a major social fad and technical revolution.<BR></UL> </P>
