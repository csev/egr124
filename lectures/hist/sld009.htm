Initially, the goal was just to make the Internet work.  One problem in any cooperative technological activity is who will be in charge.  The Internet adopted the idea of a “Federation” of networks rather than a single centrally controlled network.  Some of this approach is based on the original concepts of a network which could survive battlefield conditions.

As each site is added to the Internet, It gets a set of IP addresses and a domain name.  After this is set up, the site is free to completely administer its own section of the Internet without external intervention.  This approach allowed organizations to collaborate without having one organization having to submit to another organization’s control (Imagine if the University of Michigan had to get permission from Michigan State University each time the UM needed to add a new computer!).

From its inception, the Internet did not operate on a single vendor’s equipment.  While corporations like IBM and Digital were developing network solutions which were proprietary all the way down to the wiring used, the Internet separated the host computer, the network protocols, and the network wiring.  This allowed each technology are to evolve indpenedently.  TCP/IP could work equally well over slow long-distange modem lines and high speed local area networks because it dynamicly adaptes to the speed of the network  media.</UL> </P>
