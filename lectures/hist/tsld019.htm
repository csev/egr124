At MSU in the early days of gopher we provided a “Public Gopher” with free dial-in - no password - we wanted to share this “internet thing” with many people in the community.  Three years later we had to put passwords on our modems because otherwise we would not have been able to support or faculty/staff/students use of the modems.<BR></UL> </P>
