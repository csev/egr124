A bridge is “intelligent” network equipment which connects two Ethernet LANs.  The Bridge copies packets from one network to another until it “learns” which systems are on which side of the bridge.  Broadcasts must always be copied.  Bridges keeps a list of which ethernet addresses are on which segment.<BR></UL></P>
<P><UL>
Bridges are a very nice simple solution because they require no configuration or management but they run out of table space or suffer from too much broadcast traffic when too many networks are interconnected.<BR></UL></P>
