Originally, we read mail on an Internet connected server.  The mail would be delivered to the server, and then periodically we would log-in and run the mail program.  This has a few drawbacks, in that it does not take full advantage of the capability of the PC. A PC has a mouse, can select text, and is relatively easy to learn to write documents.

To take advantage of PC capabilities, the server is used as a post-office to hold the messages until the PC user is ready to read the messages.</UL> </P>
