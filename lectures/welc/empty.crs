By the way - this stuff is totally way-copyrighted forever and ever by me,
<a href=http://www.egr.msu.edu/~crs> Dr. Chuck </a> and
portions even belong to other folks. You are welcome to look
at them or point to my stuff as long as you
acknowlege where it came from.  You
can download the material for the purpose of off-line viewing but not for
re-publishing in any form.
<p>
Check my home page at

P.S. Sorry about this inline viewing thing, it 
is the only way for it to work both on the net and on a CD-ROM.
