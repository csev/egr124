The choice of the subdirectory web is up the the system administrator of each system but the name “web” is commonly used across different systems to eliminate confusion.
<BR></UL><UL>
You may have to set permissions properly on the web directory.  In Pilot the permissions are set properly automatically when your account is created.
</UL><UL>
The files in the web subdirectory and all of its subdirectories must generally be “world-readable” for them to be served over the web.  If you get “Permission denied” when you try to view a web page, it probably means that permissions are not set properly.

On UNIX:

	chmod ugo+rx web

	chmod ugo+r web/index.htm</UL> </P>
