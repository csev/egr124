The protocol used to deliver mail across the Internet is called SMTP or the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.  You can take a look at the specification using the URL below and then you can make up your own mind as to whether or not SMTP is truly simple.
<BR></UL><UL>
The SMTP protocol demands that the mail be delivered and acknowledged.  This is necessary because the sending system will store and attempt to deliver the message again later if it does not get positive acknowledgment of the successful delivery.  SMTP in not concerned with whether or not the message has been read, simply that the message is on the proper server ready to be read.
</UL><UL>
If the Post Office Server is not up, the system attempting to send the mail must periodically retry - usually after 2-3 days it gives up.
</UL><UL>
When the person to who the mail has been sent starts their mail reading program such as Eudora, it connects to the POP Server and downloads the messages,  Depending on the user’s configuration on the PC, the messages are either left on the server or kept n the user’s hard disk for reading.</UL> </P>
