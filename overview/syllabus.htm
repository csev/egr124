<b> Student Responsibilities and Other Course Information</b>
<ul>
<li> <b> Course Objectives:</b> The objective of this course is to learn about
the Internet and the tools to use the Internet.  A further goal of the class
is to understand how to best teach a class using the Internet.

<li> <b> Course Dates: </b>  The course will begin officially 
        January 14, 1998
and end 
        May 8, 1998
All work must be completed by 
        May 8, 1998.

<li> <b> First Week of Class (or before class starts): </b> 
Students will be required to find a location
to view and/or listen to the lectures.  This may require
installation of software on a home computer or finding an appropriately
equipped microlab.  If the students cannot view the lectures
by 
January 21, 1998
they will be dropped from the class.

<li> <b> Pacing: </b> This is not a completely modular self-paced class. 
Students should not expect to complete the class during the first few weeks, 
nor should they expect to wait to the last minute and complete all the 
work in the last two weeks of the semester.  In order to accomodate some
flexibility in schedules, the lowest homework score will be dropped 
in the computation of the homework grade.  Students unable to complete the
Mid-term or final exam at the appointed time must make arrangements with the 
instructor in advance just like in a non-virtual class.

<li> <b> Attendance: </b> Students will be expected to attend each lecture
across the Internet.  There will be a time window for each 
lecture for attendance
purposes.  Attendance will be taken using the world-wide-web.

<li> <b> Class Participation: </b> During the class, students will be expected
to participate in several activities.  First, there will be a class-wide
conferencing system with topic areas.  After each lecture, each student wil 
be required to comment on that lecture in the designated conference area.
There will be several class meetings throughout the semester in the 
chat room.  Students will be required to attend at least two of the class 
meetings.

<li> <b> On-line Homework and Exams: </b> Homework and Exams will be 
administered on-line using the CAPA system.   While it is acceptable to 
discuss homework with other people in an effort to better learn the material,
students are to work on the exams with absolutely no help from others.  By
taking this class you are agreeing to perform the exams on-line without 
assistance.

<li> <b> Continuous Quality Improvement: </b> This course and its materials
can always be improved.  The instructor invites and encourages comment on any
and all aspects of the course.  A portion of the class participation grade will
be based on the positive and negative feedback which each student gives 
regarding the course.  This feedback can take many forms.  After each 
lecture, each student is asked to rate the lecture and 
comment on how the material could be improved.  

<li> <b> Homework Questions: </b> 
Most homework sets will be available on-line for two weeks. 
As an incentive for students to begin working on the homework early,
during the first week, students who feel that a question is vague or
feel that their answer is wrong, can send E-Mail to the instructor 
identifying which question they felt was a problem, and including their
rational why the question has a problem.  The insturctor may revise the 
question or simply give the student credit for their answer.

<li> <b> Communication: </b> Most of the documentation for the course
will be made available through the World-Wide-Web and through E-Mail.
Students will be expected to use E-Mail regularly and class announcements
will be done using E-Mail.  Any course announcements will be mailed to the 
Pilot accounts of the students.
Students who do not read their E-Mail regularly (at least 3-4 times
per week) on Pilot should either forward their Pilot account to an active 
mail site or check the the class web page 3-4 times per week.
If you do not have a Pilot account, you must send the instructor your E-Mail
address during the first week of the semester.

<li> <b> Acceptable Use: </b> All students are expected to 
follow the MSU Acceptable use policy available non-line at
<a href=http://www.msu.edu/dig/aup/msuaup.html>
http://www.msu.edu/dig/aup/msuaup.html
</a>
<li> <b> Honors Options: </b> Students interested in pursuing an honors 
option should contact the instructor.
