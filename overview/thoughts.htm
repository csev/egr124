This page contains random notes regarding the class as well as some questions
and answers.
<ul>
<li>Why are the pictures so small? <br>
Because I sized everything for 640x480 and you have a 17" monitor running at
1024x768 - If I trade you for my home computer monitor, things will 
look better on your new monitor. :)
<li>Why are the pictures so big? <br>
Because you have a 17" monitor and left your resoultion at 640x480 
<li>Why are the pictures black and white and I don't even see the whole
picture on my screen? <br>
Because you have a 128K Mac-I with a 9" monitor.  Sorry I can't help you - 
you got bigger problems than having to scroll around to see the slides!
<li>Why are pictures just the right size? <br>
Because you have the same equipment as I have!
<li>What do you use to make these pages? <br>
Graphics and lectures were done in Powerpoint (If it can't be done in 
PowerPoint, don't do it).  I manipulate GIFs using LviewPro.  The 
swishing dots were made using Microsoft Paint Program spray tool and stuck
into the Powerpoint Background.  I wrote a gadget called "slideconvert"
in Microsoft Visual C++ to post-process the Internet Assistant for PowerPoint
to make my nifty-looking lecture bar because the style of
PowerPoint Internet Assistant is REALLY poor.  
(Even PowerPoint-97 is way-weak in this area) I wrote the HTML pages using
a highly-sophisticated, user friendly WYTWYG (What You Type is What You Get),
HTML editor called "vi".
<li>Why are there silly things like this page in these pages? <br>
Because sometimes I was working late at night or on a weekend and just had 
too much coffee.  Also, I kept playing the same jazz album, "Danger Zone"
by a good friend of mine - Billy Price who happens to also work at the Software
Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Melon University.  Sometimes I would 
just get to jammin' at the keyboard and something silly would come out.  
(For example, this page was typed during Cut-12 "Shake, Rattle and Roll").
</ul>
I guess that about covers it for now.  Any thing I missed?
