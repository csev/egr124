<h2>
Michigan State University <br>
College of Engineering <br>
EGR124 - Internet and Technology <br>
for High School Students <br>
</h2>
<p>
During Spring 1998 (starting January 14, 1997) we plan to have a number 
of high school students enrolled in 
<b> EGR124 - Internet and Technology</b>.
This is a class which is completely delivered over the Internet
using streaming audio, video, and other lecture materials.
The class is targeted at users who have started to use the Internet
and are interested in learning much more.
However, because of the technical 
challenges involved in delivering this type of class
we need to begin the planning process early so 
the class can begin on-time.
<p>
Other materials that you should consult in preparation for the class
include
<ul>
<li> <a href=overview.htm> Course Overview </a>
<li> Student Skill Prerequisites - Computer Familiarity, Word Processing
Skills, and Ability to use an 
Internet Browser such as Netscape or Microsoft Explorer
<li> <a href=prereq.htm> Technology Prerequisites </a>
<li> <a href=signup.htm> How to Signup for the Course </a>
</ul>

<p>
The course staff will respond to E-Mail questions at egr124@vu.msu.edu
from either the students or the technical staff at the school
so we can help work out any technical
details even before the students are registered.
<p>
In addition to the normal registration information, I would like to 
get home phone numbers and E-Mail addresses for students.  
<p>
We request that each site establish a local faculty coordinator who will
provide support for students and who will coordinate with the district
technical support team if students require technical assistance.  Your
site coordinator may be a programming teacher who is providing independent
study credit for the student.  It may be the councelor, media specialist
or classroom teacher were the student is assingned for this hour and who
manages the area were the student will be working.  The faculty
coordinator will be a key in ensuring that the learning environment is
ready for students to work in small groups or independently and act as a contact
point for communication regarding the students progress throughout the
course.
<p>
EGR124 is a two credit class so the students should budget about 2 hours per 
week to view lectures and another 4-6 hours per week outside of lecture.
The student will need Internet access during the entire 6-8 hours.  
Having a computer available outside school hours would be useful.
There will be graded work due nearly every week throughout the 15 weeks 
of the class.
<p>
To maximize learning and reduce technical issues groups of 2 to 10 students are recommended at each location.
<p>
During Fall 1997, we had a small group of high school students.  Our 
biggest problem was the technical issues with the equipment available
to the students. If you have any questions about how things went or how
to deal with K-12 rules and regulations you can either call 
<b>Diane L. Zimmerman</b>
by phone at (517) 353-8977 by fax at (517) 432-2069
or by E-mail: zimmerdl@pilot.msu.edu
or talk to 
<b>Joan Douglas</b>
at Garber High School, in Essexville, MI 
(Bay City area).  Joan's phone number is 517-894-9710.
<p>
I am looking forward to this grand experiment in on-line teaching across
the Internet.  Like all pioneers, I am a little nervous about the "unknown".
If we work together, I believe that 
we can end up with something we can all be very proud of.
I look forward to hearing from you.
