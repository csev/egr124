Thus far, we have focused our discussion on the presence of chemicals in air and soils.  Chemicals may also be transported or released directly to water.  Because of the nature of many sites, we will focus our discussion on groundwater.  As shown previously, water can be present in soils.  The groundwater can become contaminated by the release of chemicals below the surface due to leaking underground storage tanks or pipelines or due to the improper disposal of chemicals.  Groundwater can also become polluted as chemicals that were deposited on the surface of soils move through the soil to the groundwater, as was shown with lead.</UL> </P>
