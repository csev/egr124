The chemicals that are most likely to pollute groundwater are ones that dissolve easily in water. Because these chemicals would prefer to be in water rather than air or soils, they are called hydrophilic.  Hydrophilic chemicals will move with flowing water and, therefore, will tend to move with the groundwater.  An example of a hydrophilic chemical that is found in groundwater is MTBE (which stands for methyl tertiary butyl ether).  MTBE is an additive to gasoline and can find its way into groundwater due to the leakage from underground gasoline storage tanks.  Once MTBE is in groundwater it will move with the same speed as the water.  </UL> </P>
