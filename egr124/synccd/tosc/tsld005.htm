If we have determined that chemicals were released into the environment, the next thing we need to look at is: where did they go?  Are they still on the site?  Did they move through the environment from the medium in which they were released into another medium?  For example, a chemical that was released into the air can be transported to other media, namely, soil, groundwater, surface water, biota (that is, plants or animals) or even sediments.  For purposes of this discussion we’re going to focus here on the issue of how chemicals move into the air, soils, and groundwater.</UL> </P>
