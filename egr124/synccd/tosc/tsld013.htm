However, in some cases, lead may be found at some distance from where it was deposited.  Where lead has moved from a site, it is likely to have attached to very small particles that are able to move with the groundwater as the water flows from the site.  Those particles can be carried with the groundwater and move considerable distances in the ground.  As shown here, this water can move either vertically or horizontally from the site.
