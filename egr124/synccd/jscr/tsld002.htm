A script is a computer program that is not compiled (or translated) like C/C++ or Java are.  JavaScript is a scripting language that is often used in HTML documents to provide interactivity and flexibility in Web pages.  JavaScript programs are written directly into HTML documents and are translated by the user’s Internet browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.).
