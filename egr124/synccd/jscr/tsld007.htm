Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are used for many forms of user interaction on the Internet.  Interactive forms, for example, often use CGI scripts to send information.  Writing CGI scripts is somewhat complicated, however, and requires knowledge of a programming language like Perl.  JavaScript is much simpler to use and, since it is self-contained, non-programmers can easily incorporate pre-made JavaScript code into their HTML documents and add interactivity to their webpages.</UL> </P>
