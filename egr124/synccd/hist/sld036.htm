JAVA was introduced in 1994 - It has been termed - “The most important Technology event after the Internet”.  By 1994, journalists had all reported all about the “new internet” and gotten over it.  In 1994, they were looking for the next story and JAVA popped up.  It got a lot of hype and less than a year after its introduction, hundreds of books were written, colleges were teaching JAVA classes.  A little over 500 days later, there were products which were based on this new language/operating environment.

While many are excited that JAVA is the language of the Internet, its greatest contribution might bethe fact that it is operating system independent.  It is possible to write complete applications in JAVA - See

For a JAVA word-processor which should run on any system.

Because of the fact that JAVA does not depend on the operating system, some computer vendors are concerned that they might lose market share.  Expect to see competing products to JAVA to be developed to protect these market segments.
