Each packet in TCP/IP has a field called “Time to live” or TTL. Each time the packet passes across a  hop, this count is decremented by on. If this count reaches zero, the packet is discarded and the sending  host is notified. Normal packets are sent with the TTL set to 255. 
<BR></UL><UL>
     The traceroute (UNIX) or tracert (Windows) command sends a packet out with TTL set to 1. Then it sets the count to 2 and sends the packet again. By doing this until a packet reaches its final destination, the traceroute command can determine the path a packet takes through the Internet. 
</UL><UL>
     The “best” route through the Internet may change at any instant - even while a traceroute command is running.

     Interestingly, traceroute will work to some degree when the destination does not exist. Try
