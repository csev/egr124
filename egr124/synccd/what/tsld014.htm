A large organization such as Michigan State University or Ford Motor Company generally connects directly to a regional network provider. Michigan State is a member of the Merit Network which operates the Michigan regional network. Because of this relationship, the link from MSU to the Internet is used for far more traffic than just the MSU traffic. Companies and educational institutions from western, central, and northern Michigan send their traffic through the MSU campus on the way to the Internet.

One aspect of the Internet is that the cost to connect a new site to the Internet depends on how far it is to the nearest well-connected site. Also when you improve the connectivity of a central site such as Michigan State University, the connectivity of the entire Northwestern area of the state is improved.</UL> </P>
