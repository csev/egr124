The telephone company moves voice between two phones. There is no difference if you are shouting or thinking silently. If you dial the phone, and then don’t talk for 30 minutes, you cannot ask for a refund of your money. For data connections and for ISDN data connections, once a connection is made, data is passed continuously regardless of whether or not the two systems actually have anything to say.

     The phone company can afford to guarantee the bandwidth because you pay for it whether or not you use it or not when you are dialing long distance. Unfortunately for local calls, there is no such connect-time charge. This is one of the reasons that phone companies are unhappy about the long local phone calls made by Internet users.

    The telephone companies are breaking this mold of continuous data in the introduction of ASDL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) technology.</UL> </P>
