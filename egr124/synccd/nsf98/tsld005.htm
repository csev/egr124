After I have taught a course for four years, I either am bored or have written a book.  We need tools which develop a course and a book at the same time.  As the course becomes more and more complete, cohesive, and polished, it approaches a book.  At that point, it would be nice to press a button, an voila - out comes some printer-ready galleys and a CD-ROM with lectures and examples and a teachers’ guide.

There are so many ways that a teacher gains information in a course.  For example, I can learn a lot from grading hand-written tests beyond the simple correctness of the answer.  Which areas are disorganized or have been erased or crossed out.  Which lectures have worse attendance or worse attention.  Which lectures did I feel like a robot when I gave.  We need to extract these subtle issues in a world of computer-graded quizzes and on-line lectures.  We need to invent techniques to catch subtle clues from the information we have available - I call this a “learner model” and a “teacher model”.  I want each morning to click on a web page and see the Red, Yellow and Green students.  The Red students need a phone call, the yellow students need an E-Mail and the green students need a pat on the back.

I want my on-line course to change as the students take the course.  I want them to be able to add their comments to each portion of the course.  I want them to rate each quiz question - I want them to make up quiz questions.  I want them to answer each other’s questions and get credit for right answers.  It is a live environment that they are part of.</UL> </P>
