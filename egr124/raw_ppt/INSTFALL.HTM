<p>Activity:</u> The task of each group is to to submit a 3 page group report which
includes discussion of&nbsp; strengths and weakness of the two university homepages (MSU
and Uof M) and a recommendation on how to redesign the homepage of MSU.&nbsp; You&nbsp;
and the rest of your group will support your recommendation based on the design theory
from lecture 3, Design of Web-pages, and other readings of your choice. You are required
to discuss the project with your classmates WebTalk.</p>

<p>Here is scenario which you are to use the design concepts learned from the lecture to
solve the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <u><p>Scenario</u>: Your group is working as web-page designers for a company which
    produces web-pages for higher education institutions. Your group is assigned to redesign a
    homepage of Michigan State University. Your boss asks you to submit a 3 page report which
    discusses the strengths and weakness of current MSU homepage (http://www.msu.edu) in
    comparison with the homepage of University of Michigan (http://www.umich.edu) and a
    recommendation on how to redesign the homepage of MSU.</p>

<p><u>Support tools</u></p>

<p>We suggest&nbsp; that you use two strategies called &quot;self-explanation&quot; and
&quot;self-monitoring&quot; to help you understand new concepts resulting in better
performance in problem solving situations. </p>

<p>Self-explanation strategies are a) summarizing a lecture by identifying main ideas, b)
working with concepts using concrete examples, and c) connecting the main ideas with
concepts and examples. </p>

<p>Self-monitoring strategies are a) Planning your learning activities by asking questions
such as &quot;is there anything I need to think about as I progress&quot;, and b)
Clarifying and addressing problems by asking yourself questions such as &quot;what I do
need to know&quot;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &quot; what needs to be clarified?&quot; </p>

<p>We have several forms to help you use these techniques. After you listen to the
lecture,&nbsp; Please write your answers below.</p>
