Both Java and JavaScript are used widely in Web page design, but they are completely separate languages.  Java is a full-fledged computer programming language, and the code must be compiled (translated) before the computer can interpret it.  Java code is stored in a separate file and is identified with the HTML tag &#060APPLET&#062.  JavaScript is not compiled and is written directly into the HTML document, using the tag &#060SCRIPT&#062.

Java is currently less reliable than JavaScript, and computers with earlier versions of Internet browsers often crash when trying to open a Java program.  Because JavaScript allows client-side functionality, it is generally faster than Java programs.</UL> </P>
