A function is a defined set of actions that the computer takes when the function is called from another part of the program.  In JavaScript, a function’s name and the actions it takes are defined in the &#060HEAD&#062 of the HTML document.  These functions can then be called from the &#060BODY&#062 of the document and the computer will carry out the instructions defined in the &#060HEAD&#062.</UL> </P>
