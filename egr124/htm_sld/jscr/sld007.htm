Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are used for many forms of user interaction on the Internet.  Interactive forms, for example, often use CGI scripts to send information.  Writing CGI scripts is somewhat complicated, however, and requires knowledge of a programming language like Perl.  JavaScript is much simpler to use and, since it is self-contained, non-programmers can easily incorporate pre-made JavaScript code into their HTML documents and add interactivity to their webpages.</UL> </P>

<P><UL>
<LI><H2>Provide interactivity without CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripts or Java
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Makes forms, searches, and other types of web interaction faster, easier, and more reliable (doesn’t crash machines as often as Java does!)
</UL></UL><UL>
<LI><H2>Communication within browser windows
</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Let frames “talk” to each other so you can change information in one frame without having to reload the entire webpage
<LI>“MouseOver” actions respond to user actions</UL></UL></P>
