Client-side scripting means that the JavaScript code is downloaded by a user’s Internet browser and then interpreted by that browser on the user’s computer, which is called the client.  This is generally faster than server-side applications, which must be run on the computer where the files themselves originate (called the server).  In webpages, the server is the computer where the files for the webpage are stored.</UL> </P>
