There are too many URLs to practically index everything.  Search engines are beginning to prune their searches.  In 1995, the limiting factor was the amount of net they could search in a 24 hour period.  Now with 3+ years of searching they have a lot of stuff.  They cannot continue to do a complete index so they must rank the information in terms of value.  This is pretty difficult to accomplish. Probably the first areas that will get pruned will be user home directories which has some of the most diverse material on the net.  
<BR></UL><UL>
The search engines will have to use metrics to rank the value of the information such as how many links point to the page.  Another metric will probably be the length of the URL and how recently the data was updated.  The search engines will have to spend a good portion of their time  re-verifying their information to minimize the incorrect links.</UL> </P>
