The most fundamental form of interpersonal communication over the Internet is E-Mail.  Because E-Mail is not instantaneous communication, it can function on low-speed unreliable networks quite effectively.  Before the Internet, many users used a network called UUNET for E-Mail.  UUNET did not depend on the network being up continuously.  Periodically, each system would dial-up its neighbors and transfer any queued mail to the next system.  Eventually mail would arrive at its destination, sometimes taking as long as a week.

One the Internet, systems attempt to deliver E-Mail even when there are partial network outages.  Since mail messages are relatively small, if a message cannot be immediately transferred to its designation, it is saved on the local system.  After some time period (typically 1/2 hour) the transfer is tried again.  This makes E-Mail one of the most reliable activities on the Internet.

When E-Mail usage moved form UUNET to the Internet, the Mail was generally delivered directly to the final destination across the Internet.

One observation is that E-Mail is not much use if you have to call someone to tell them to read their mail.  However at some point people read E-Mail so often that it is the fastest way to contact them if they don’t pick up the phone.  It is often faster than leaving voice mail or a message on an answering machine</UL> </P>
