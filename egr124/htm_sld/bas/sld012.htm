Because a PC may be shut off when a person leaves the office or it may not be connected to the Internet when the modem is not dialed, it is not practical to deliver directly to a PC.  Typically the mail is delivered to a server permanently attached to the Internet  This way, the mail can be delivered the instant the sender completes the message.  When the receiver starts their system, it downloads the mail from the server to be read.
<BR></UL><UL>
This is called the post office protocol because it is very similar to having a Post Office Box.  You do not have to be present when the mail is delivered into the box.  You stop in at your convenience and pick up the mail which has been placed in the box.</UL> </P>
