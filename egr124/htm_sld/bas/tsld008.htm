An E-Mail address is a precise way to contact a person.  As long as your mail system supports Internet style addresses if someone types that address into their mail program you will get the information.  Mail addresses are unique across the Internet.  In a sense it is like a pager number.

Often people put their E-Mail addresses on business cards and other forms of correspondence to allow people to contact them easily.

E-Mail addresses are VERY precise - much like phone numbers. crs@egr.msu.edu is not the same as chuck@michigan.state.university or dr.chuck@msu.  A single typo nearly always makes the E-Mail addresses incorrect and the resulting mail undeliverable.
