POP is a great solution to allowing PC users to read their mail using graphical programs.  However a problem occurs when a user often moves from one PC to another regularly.  When the user moves, the messages stored on the local disk do not move with the user.  One solution is to configure Eudora to leave the messages on the server but that still does not solve the problem of “folders”.  
<BR></UL><UL>
Folders are where a user stores a message for reference.  For example, it is common to create a folder for a topic such as “Every message sent to me regarding the cps291 class”.  These folders are stored on the hard disk and do not follow a moving user around.

A solution to this problem is a new “post-office” protocol called IMAP.  IMAP can store all messages and all folders on the server to allow completely movable users.
