One of the most convenient capabilities of E-Mail is the capability of sending attachments.  With an attachment, you compose a short message like, “Johnm here is the spreadsheet”, then “attach the .XLS file to the mail message.  When the message is received, the mail program allows the contents to be saved to disk.

One problem with attachments is that there are too many types.  Each mail reader seems to have its favorite type and can read a few of the other types.  Unfortunately not all reader programs can read all types.

Saving an attachment is like reading a disk of a floppy.  It can contain a virus which would negatively affect the performance of your system.  Top end virus checking software automatically checks incoming attachments for viruses.</UL> </P>
