The Internet does not require a great deal of administrative oversight. It was designed to allow each  organization ot control much of their internet configuration. However there are a few areas which there  must be some cooperation. 
<BR></UL><UL>
The Internet numbers (35.8.2.41) and domain names ( www.msu.edu ) are managed by an organization called the Internic. The internic gives these numbers (35.8.*.*) and addresses (*.msu.edu) in large  groups and allows each organization to manage their own numbers and names. 
</UL><UL>
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is the organization which develops technical standards (called Request for Comments) which govern how the Internet works. Typically engineers from  companies producing Internet hardware and software participate in the IETF.</UL> </P>
