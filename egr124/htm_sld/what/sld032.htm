AOL in a sense provides a complete networking solution. AOL owns a national network, regional networks, and local networks in most cities with dial-up modems. AOL also provides the AOL software, electronic mail, and network content. 
<BR></UL><UL>
     With total control over its infrastructure, AOL could theoretically provide a far superior service to the Internet. Users of both the Internet and AOL, often prefer AOL for interpersonal communication. AOL could solve many of the technical problems of the Internet because it has a completely proprietary solution. AOL has accounting and could easily charge for reliable long-distance “Internet Phone”. 
</UL><UL>
The problem that AOL faces is that it loses users to fixed-cost Internet providers. At the end of 1996, AOL introduced a competitive fixed-rate plan. It is not clear that they can afford to support the increase in use that the fixed-rate plan will cause. 
</UL><UL>
     At some point AOL may have to give up its national, regional and local networks and concentrate on  providing content across the Internet.</UL> </P>
