     Marshall McLuhan wrote that new media tend to encapsulate older media. That is, old media can be represented within the space of new media. The alphabet as a medium was encapsulated  by print; radio as a medium was encapsulated by television.   I can send a radio broadcast via television and could even use my television solely as a radio if I felt like it (although it may not be practical).   What many people have failed to understand is that the computer  as a medium has the potential to encapsulate all prior media.   Therefore, the interface and working environment of the future will be able to handle or simulate all of the various forms of  media.</UL> </P>
