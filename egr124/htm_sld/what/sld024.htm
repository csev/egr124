As our capability for local access gets faster and faster, the national backbone will have difficulty keeping up. Most of the national connections are at the maximum 45Mb/second rate. To go faster (1Gb/sec) requires the use of fiber. One experimental national network is already in place http://www.vbns.net/ which is operating at 1GB/sec. While the speed of fiber is 20 times faster, it is far more expensive than the current high speed lines. Furthermore as the local connections increase a factor of five as we go from Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) to ISDN and the number of Internet users increase, this factor of 20 will be consumed. 
<BR></UL><UL>
     As we use the Internet more and more for multi-media, our access patterns will change. When a user is surfing the web and actually reading the material on their screen, they might only use 10-20% of their available connection. If a user is listening to audio or viewing video over the Internet, they use 100% of their connection. Also the use of Internet Phone technology uses a large amount of bandwidth. 
</UL><UL>
     Even the local telephone company who charges 8.3 cents per phone call is feeling the pinch. Many users with two lines, keep their Internet connection all day long. Given that the average voice phone call is about 3 minutes, areas with a high population of Internet users are concerned about their telephone   system capacity.

     At some point all these issues come down to an economic issue. We will either redesign the Internet to some degree or the cost will increase as our use of the net increases. But for now intense competition keeps the costs down.</UL> </P>
