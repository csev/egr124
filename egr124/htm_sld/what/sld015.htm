Local Service providers may be national services providers, regional providers, or just a local company which purchases a connection to a regional or national network. The economics of a Local Service provider is to keep their customers happy (no busy signals) while paying for their modems, servers, telephone costs, staff costs, and network access fees and still make a bit of profit.      There are thousands of local services providers around the country. At some point in the future there will be some shakeout among these smaller companies. The current rate for unlimited access over a 28. modem is from $10.00 - $20.00 per month. At those rates, the profit margin is small and the competition is fierce.

Unless end-users get access free through their job, they generally pay a fee only to the local provider - all of the national network infrastructure is included.</UL> </P>
