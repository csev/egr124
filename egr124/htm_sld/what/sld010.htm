The worldwide Internet is a hierarchy of cooperating networks with each network selling services to the lower levels of the hierarchy.  While I have shown three levels of the hierarchy, it is much more complicated.  For example, a national provider such as Sprint or MCI can and does provide what we would call “local service”.  There are a number of national service providers - all the national service providers are interconnected at critical points around the world  to make the Internet appear to be seamless.  These access points are called NAPs or Network Access Points.  A regional level service provider is roughly the size of a state although some are a portion of a state and others are made up of several states.  Local service providers are companies who sell Internet access to the end-customers.
