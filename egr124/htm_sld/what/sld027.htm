In the long run (which may be 30 years) the telephone companies will probably consume the Internet. There is little economic reason to have thousands of companies which make up the Internet to completely re-engineer the Internet to do things which the phone companies already do. The current situation simply assures us that if the phone companies are incapable of providing good quality data service at reasonable prices, the Internet will eat their lunch and the phone companies may eventually just be leasing long-distance fiber optic cables to the Internet companies. 
<BR></UL><UL>
     The biggest challenge to telephone companies is to abandon the synchronous data transmission and allow idle periods to cost far less than active periods.
