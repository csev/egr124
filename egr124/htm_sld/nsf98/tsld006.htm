The network-based/shareware approach is great for gadgets.  It is horrible for complex systems.  Is there yet a good free non-commercial  word processor?  Free high quality courseware development tools will NOT evolve.  Yet existing commercial tools are inadequate so we must innovate to survive.  This means that  thousandss of course are taking divergent paths - having a standard approach is good for interoperability - but it needs to be a good solution too.

Funding is attracted to - “If this gets funded - all poverty, pain, suffering and general unfairness in the world will end.  If this does not get funded - a comet will hit earth and we will all be vaporized and die instantly.”  Many great innovations come from puttering.</UL> </P>
