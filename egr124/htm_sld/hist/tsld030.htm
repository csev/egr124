The weather site at MSU was one of the first weather sites with real-time weather animation.  For the first few years of the web revolution this was one of the top-10 sites in most lists.  This site was developed by an undergraduate student at MSU called Charles Henrich  After about four years, this site was retired in April 1997 after hundreds of millions of hits.  So this slide is now an antique in the Internet sense.<BR></UL> </P>
