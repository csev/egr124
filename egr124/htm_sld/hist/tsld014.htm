Fermat was a brilliant mathematician who lived in the 1600’s.  After he died, other mathematicians examined his notes and found many brilliant proofs. Before his death he claimed to a colleague, “I have a beautiful and elegant proof to this (the above) theorem”.
</UL><UL>
Three hundred years after his death, this was the only of Fermat’s theorems which remained unproved  (hence the title “Fermat’s Last Theorem”).
