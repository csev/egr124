Interestingly, HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was invented about the same time as Gopher.  HTML is the language used to “mark-up” the hypertext aspects of web documents and to interate the multimedia aspects of the documents into the text portions of the documents.
<BR></UL><UL>
However because there was no free software available to view HTML effectively it was not immediately a hit.  HTML was over two years old when Mosaic was developed at NCSA (National Center for Supercomputing Applications) at university of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1993.

Mark Andreesen had an $20,000 SGI on the desk at NCSA - So did everyone else at NCSA - assumed graphics, networking, an multimedia three years before it was commonplace.</UL> </P>
