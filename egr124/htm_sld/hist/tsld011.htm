Terminasl were primitive - many did not even have cursor keys, function keys, windows or a mouse.  Some printed right onto paper.  A terminal used in 1975 was a printing terminal which used a roll of paper called a TTY-33  which communicated at 110 bits/second.  That is a long way from  a 200Mhz Pentium, Windows-95 and a 100,000,000 bits/second Ethernet card.
