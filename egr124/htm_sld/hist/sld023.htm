As the Internet was emeging in the early 1990’s there was a national level push to create a “Information Superhighway System” similar to the road system.  This was viewed as critical to national leadership in the technology area.  In 1993, the national Information Infrastructure vision had a very telephone and cable TV centric perspective.  The internet was viewed as an interesting “toy”.  However by 1995,the Internet had taken over as the vision for the National Information Infrastructure.
