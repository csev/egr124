Let’s look now at how chemicals move to the soil. As stated earlier, chemicals can be released into the air and settle on ground surfaces.  From there, the chemicals can dissolve in water and move with the water through the soil.  Chemicals can also enter the soil through leaks in underground storage tanks and pipes.  Additionally, chemicals can enter the soil through spills on the ground surface.  
</UL><UL>
Once chemicals enter the soil a number of things may happen.  They may attach tightly to the soil.  Or, they may not stick to the soil, and  may be carried deeper into the soil by rain water or groundwater, if either is present. As mentioned earlier, chemicals may also volatilize and move through the soil as vapors.  Chemicals that are hydrophobic (that is, they do not want to mix with water) are not likely to move very far in the soil, as they will tend to attach to the soil particles.
</UL><UL>
Once chemicals are attached to the soil, they can, over time, slowly detach from the soil particles, moving farther from where they were initially deposited.</UL> </P>
