The second step in a Site Assessment is to determine the amount of chemicals that were released to the environment.  Keep in mind that just because a chemical was used at a site doesn’t mean it was released to the environment.  Current regulations require that precise records of emissions be maintained and reported.  However, at older sites, records containing this information are not likely to exist.  Since documented information may not be available, we might have to look at other sources of information.  Those sources may include interviewing former employees to obtain information about what, where and how much was used or released?  However, the accuracy of these records may be questionable since it is difficult for people to remember that far back.  Additionally, the people that are interviewed may not know specific information such as the chemical name.  For example, they may only remember that a release of a yellow powder occurred.</UL> </P>
