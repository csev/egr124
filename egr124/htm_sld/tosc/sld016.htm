In summary, we have discussed that chemicals can be released to air, soils or water.  They can also move from one medium to another.  The properties of the chemical of concern are important in determining the location of the chemical.  For example, hydrophilic, or water-soluble chemicals will tend to be found in water. Hydrophobic chemicals will tend to be found in soils or air. Volatile chemicals will prefer to be in air rather than in water or soil.  
</UL><UL>
Once it is determined what chemicals might be have been used at the site, then the soils, water and air will be sampled and analyzed to determined if these chemicals are still present.  These activities are the next step in a Site Investigation and will be discussed in our next presentation. </UL> </P>
