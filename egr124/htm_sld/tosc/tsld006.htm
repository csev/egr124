Let’s look first at how chemicals move into the air.  Chemicals that are volatile, that is those chemicals that do not want to remain as liquids or solids, will readily evaporate into the air.  For example, the chemical benzene in gasoline is volatile and if you were to leave an open container of gasoline in a room, you would be able to smell benzene in the air.  Many of the chemicals that volatilize are also hydrophobic, that means that they do not want to be in water.  Again, let’s use gasoline as our example.  If you were to mix gasoline and water in a container, much of the benzene would go into the air rather than into the water. That is because benzene is both volatile and hydrophobic.  Another group of hydrophobic chemicals are known as the semivolatiles.  Many semivolatile chemicals are also commonly found in gasoline but these chemicals are much less volatile than benzene.  Therefore, in our example of the container with water and gasoline, the semivolatile chemicals are more likely to remain in the gasoline than to move into either the air or the water.</UL> </P>
