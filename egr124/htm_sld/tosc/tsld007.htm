This diagram illustrates what we were just discussing.

During the operation of an industrial facility the release of volatile and semivolatile chemicals directly into the air may have resulted from evaporation of chemicals from open tanks; for example, from tanks containing solvents used in degreasing metal parts.  Additionally, these chemicals could have been released from spills onto building floors or the soil surface. As shown here in this picture, spills of substances containing volatile chemicals could result in the release of the volatile compounds.  This may occur as the chemical evaporates and the vapors move through the soil into the air, basements and other locations.  Lastly, the volatile chemicals may be released to the air during  certain types of clean up actions, such as the excavation of soils that contain gasoline.  However, current regulations require that steps be taken to minimize the release of these chemicals during excavation.</UL> </P>
