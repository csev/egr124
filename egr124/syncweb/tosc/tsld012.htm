At many sites, metals are present.  Because lead is a metal that is of major concern due to its toxicity, it will be used as an example in this discussion.  Most forms of lead do not want to mix with water, so lead is called insoluble (or hydrophobic).  As such, it will usually attach to the soil particles and will not move very far from where it was deposited.  </UL> </P>
