So far, we’ve discussed the release of chemicals into the air.  Another source of air pollution is the release of particulates or very small fragments of material.  This kind of material is small enough to be carried with air currents.  It may be as large as the pollen you see in Spring that settles on outside surfaces or as small as the particles in tobacco smoke. Particulates may be discharged into the air from the stacks at industrial facilities, or from mechanical grinding processes, or from combustion processes.  Cleanup activities at hazardous waste sites can, potentially, also cause the release of particulates into the air.  Examples include: the demolition of equipment that was used to remove particulates from air that was discharged from the facility; or the excavation of soils, especially during high winds or if the soils are dry.  During any of the activities, efforts must be taken to minimize the release of dust. Air quality monitoring must also be carried out to assure protection of human health.</UL> </P>
