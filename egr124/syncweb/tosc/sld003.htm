The first step in determining what chemicals might be present is to look at what industrial and other kinds of activities occurred at the Site.  For example, was the Site used for electroplating? For paint manufacturing? For photographic processing?  From the evaluation of those activities we can determine what chemicals might have been used at the site.  In some cases, this information is not readily available and we will need to look at other sources to determine what chemicals might have been used at that type of manufacturing facility.  It’s also important to know where specific chemicals were used…in what buildings? In what portion of the site?  Were there chemicals that were stored in tanks?  Were the tanks above or below ground?  Are the tanks still present?  Are chemicals still in the tanks?  These are just some of the basic questions we need to ask in this first stage of the site investigation.</UL> </P>
