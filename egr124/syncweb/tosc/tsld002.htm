Once it is discovered that a site may be contaminated a site investigation and risk assessment must be performed.  In conducting the site investigation, it first must be determined what chemicals are present, how much of these chemicals have been deposited and where these chemicals are or where have they gone?  So, in this talk I will discuss what steps are involved in answering those questions.</UL> </P>
