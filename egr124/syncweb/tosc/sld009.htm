As shown here, particulates that are released will be transported by wind currents.  The distance the material is transported will depend on wind speed, but also on the size, shape and density of the particulates. Heavier particles will likely settle on ground surfaces before lighter ones.  The major concern related to particulate matter is the inhalation of very small sized particles, since this material can be transported into the lungs, carrying with it any toxic chemicals attached to the particle.  As an example, this is the major way toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke are transported into the lungs.  Once these chemicals are in the lungs, they can move into the tissue, resulting in negative health effects.

As previously mentioned, once particulate matter falls from the air, it is deposited on surfaces.  In some cases,  the particulate matter contains chemicals that can dissolve in water.  The dissolved chemicals can then move down into the soil. </UL> </P>
