We have been discussing the movement of chemicals in soils.  Hopefully, this illustration will help you understand this process.  
</UL><UL>
The soil particles are shown here as large solid material (cross-hatched areas).  Chemicals can attach to the surface of the particles.  As I stated, the chemicals can also detach over time and move into the air space between particles.  This is most likely to occur in that portion of the soil that is not completely saturated with water.  As shown in this picture, below the water table are soil particles that are saturated with water (no air is present in these pore spaces).  If chemicals detach from soil particles in this region, they are most likely to move into the groundwater, especially if the chemicals are hydrophilic.  Hydrophilic means that the chemical wants to stay in water.  Hydrophilic is the opposite of hydrophobic.
