With the development of Mosaic and the founding of Netscape Comunications Corporation it became quickly clear that the Web was innnovating much more rapidly than the personal computer market.  There quikly became the talk of the web browser changing froma simple program to a program which controlled your enrite desktop and launched other programs as necessary.  This threatened existing hardware and operating systems manufacturers.  Because netscape ran on multiple computer types (PC, Mac, UNIX) and on multiple operating systems, people might actually be able to choose the best hardware/operating system and casue too much competition.

Microsoft saw this threat to the dominance of their operating system and developed Microsoft Explorer - a competitive web browser.  While Netscape has continually tried to make revenue from their browser, Microsoft has given Explorer away for nothing so far.  (does this sound familiar???)  Microsoft has also added web/internet features across its product line.</UL> </P>
