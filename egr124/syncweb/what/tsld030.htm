While in 1996, many people think of the Internet as far superior to AOL, we must remember that AOL was successful in the broad marketplace long before the Internet. Because of the overhead and specifications of the TCP/IP protocols, using the Internet at 2400 baud is just not practical. With the advent of 14,400 and 28,800 modems using the Internet at home has became more practical..

     Unfortunately in the world of High-Tech, the pertinent question is, “What have you done for me lately?”. AOL is struggling to find its place in a marketplace where it is continuously compared to the Internet rather than Prodigy and Compuserve.</UL> </P>
