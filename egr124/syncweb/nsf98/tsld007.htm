We universities are pushing many different envelopes.  But our technology is always too narrow and never mature enough to move to hundreds of other places.  The old approach of “put up on the net and they will come” does not work for complex tools.  People need support for complex tools.  People need to know when the next version is coming out.  Universities like making stuff - they hate supporting stuff because all those students left and the faculty member is off on a new grant!  The only solution is to get valuable technology into the hands of companies so it can become a broadly used product.

Take off overhead  for the University, College and Department based on some formula and give the rest  to the faculty member as a grant after paying for TA’s and other expenses.  The grant can be used for travel, summer salary, graduate students, or equipment. After all, all we really want is $100,000 per year so we can tinker with things we find interesting...
