<P>Ever since the dawn of the World Wide Web people have touted it as one of the single greatest accomplishments thus far in history.  It was first developed to help the military and business&#146;s communicate and become more productive on a global scale. Since that time it has evolved into something that is unbelievable and bigger than life itself. Not only is it used to help the military and large companies communicate but also it has become a global pass time for people. The World Wide Web has impacted our lives in many ways, and I think that one of the newest and best ways is in the field of education. </P>
<P>	The Web has been used by educational institutions for many years now. It has been used to transmit files, browse information and download software. Now the question is can it be used for direct educational purposes? The answer to that I think is a resounding yes. I say this because the class that I have participated in has been one of the most interesting and captivating classes that I have ever taken. Why is this you may ask? Well there are several reasons that my class over the Web has been so unique. </P>
<P>	One of the first benefits that I see with this type of class is the great amount of flexibility that it offers.  In this day and age people of all ages and abilities are attending college. People that live near a college or have to commute to it are growing in numbers and the need for alternative education is ever clear. With this class it was possible to review course material, listen to lectures, and meet with fellow students in many different locations. As long as you could get to a computer that had basic system properties you could do what you needed to do. This is a tremendous advantage for people who are handicapped, have children, live a distance away from the institution, or for any other reason would have a hard time making it into class on a regular basis. With the increasing number of people working this is a viable option from the usual way of taking a class. 	</P>

</B>Another advantage of this class is the rich educational experience that the student receives in contrast to the traditional classroom setting.  In classes that can be taught over the web, the instructors can utilize the newest technologies to aid in the instruction of the student. For example with this class you could go to the home page and not only print out your notes but listen to the audio of the lecture and see a video clip that pertained to the lecture. While you were listening to the lecture, slides would be displayed in synchronization to the topic of the lecture. This is a wonderful change from sitting in a classroom taking notes at a hundred miles an hour while you cannot concentrate on what the instructor is saying.  If you miss something you can go back and review it as many times as you want. When it is test time you could do it right over the Internet. In this case you could see how you were doing on the exam as you were taking it. There was no waiting for the test to be grade, it happened right away. 
<P>	Another benefit of the class was the projects that we did. By having to develop a web page of our own it helped us to learn and important skill in today&#146;s world. Web page development is a very useful skill to have because the web is everywhere in today&#146;s business world. In addition to making the page we were able to see other students homepages and get a personal view of them even though it was over a computer.  This gives the student a way to express themselves in a way that was different from the normal experience. </P>

<P>A final plus to this course was the way that students could meet online to ask question or discuss classroom topics. By meeting in a chat room with other students it gave us a chance to talk more freely with classmates. Being on a computer breaks down anxiety of speaking in public and being afraid to ask questions. </P>
<P>	As I think that this class was a wonderful idea and hopefully one that continues to be used and evolve, there are a few things that are on the down side.  For one there is the possibility for people to have computer problems which can effect their school work. I know this because it happened to me. My computer crashed which made it hard from me to keep up with the class work. This is not to say that a person would be totally cut off from the class in this event but it does make it harder to participate during these times. This is something I think could not be help no matter how the class is organized, computers go down and that is a fact of life so it just has to be taken in stride. </P>
<P>	A second issue that can hamper the experience is the fact that the class is flexible. Flexibility is a double-edged sword because it can have positive or negative effects. For many people it is a wonderful thing because it can be molded to fit their schedule. For some people however because it is something that can be done in a more relaxed period of time it can often be pushed back until it has to be done at the last minute. This can happen in any class but I think it would b more likely to happen in one like this. </P>
<P>	Overall I think this class is the wave of the future. With the exception of the few downsides that were mentioned above, I think it is the ideal way to educate people. Due to the ability to continually upgrade technology and integrate new developments that class will never remain static. You can do things as simple as reading a text document or as advanced as using a camera to videoconference with the rest of your classmates. With all the possibilities that this area holds I think that the future is very bright for any college or institution that utilizes this teaching method. </P>
