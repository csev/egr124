     This class is a spectacular example of what the web is capable of.  Universities and colleges across the nation are just beginning to realize the possiblities for instructional delivery across the web.  Students are a great tool for experimenting on.  Professors, along with their students, are developing new ways to improve web technology by working together.  Professors are encouraging students to encounter different high-tech challenges that arise when dealing with computers and computer programs.  They meet these challenges, trying along the way to, conquer them or develop a new method to go around them.  The professor inturn, relies on the students imput to develop new web programming that will aid both parties involved.  As long as the professors and students can keep working at ways to improve instructional delivery, there will be growing trend of classes such as this.<BR>
     Computers are becoming more user friendly.  There are plenty of books available to aid you in any problem you encounter.  For those who already are familiar with the web, access to web tools is simply just a click on the mouse.  With the price of computers becoming more affordable, many students have their own computers or they have access to them from their dorms.  Computer knowledge is increasing, thanks to universities and colleges that require a computer class to graduate.  This class would be a great computer introduction class.  In this class you learn about things such as, search engines, that would aid a college student in researching a specific topic for a paper.  Students can become familiar with different chat groups, some maybe at other colleges, that would help them get a better grasp of a concept they don't fully understand.  E-mail makes it easy to contact a professor or fellow classmate with a question not answered in class.  Real audio and video make it possible to take a class if you are out of the state, or country.  All these are examples of strengths of the web, wheither accessing from school, home, or work.<BR>
     Depending on the web server you are using, several problems can arise.  I currently have AOL, which uses microsoft explorer.  Consistency is not its strong point.  Sometimes it takes 10-15 tries before I get a connection.  Lately I have been lucky, I usually get it on the first or secong try.  Then again my modem isn't exactly fast.  Another problem I often encounter is network traffic, mostly when using real audio or video.  The audio stops or skips, making the lecture hard to follow.  Then there are plain, old interruptions.  Screens just pop up out of nowhere while your downloading or trying to listen to a lecture.  For anyone who has a buddy list, this is a slight annoyance.  Sometimes I just get kicked off because my computer has performed an illegal action.  These problems deal more with the network then the class itself.<BR>
     I am gradually learning what I can do with my computer and what it is capable of.  I am not a computer buff and know little about the structure of my computer. I do know that I have learned what the web is about and how it can be used.  I feel that this is what the class was designed for.  So I feel any areas of improvement would come with more knowledge about computers in general.  That should be up the to student taking the class.  As the networks and broswers become stronger, we should see a change in reliablity and speed.  As for the class itself, I thought the structure was great.  Having a lecture with auto flip slides is just like sitting in a classroom, just without all the distractions or the hike across campus.<BR>
