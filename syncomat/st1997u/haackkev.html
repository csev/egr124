	The internet, known as the web, appropriate for such a mechanism, allows people<BR>
<BR>
 to link information to anyone with the internet.  Weather it is around the corner<BR>
<BR>
 are around the world.The inforation is trasported throughout the web.  There are<BR>
<BR>
 two sides to the internet, those who advertise their services or buisnesses, and those<BR>
<BR>
 who view the web for information available on it. The sides can most easily be<BR>
<BR>
 identified as the eutropreneurs and consumers.  The entrepreneurs publish what<BR>
<BR>
 they have to offer on the web to expand their buisness.  They publish what they<BR>
<BR>
 have colleted in order to better educate the public offering these facts in a most<BR>
<BR>
 convenent way.<BR>
			<BR>
One of the strenghts of using the web is that computers are slowly becoming a<BR>
<BR>
standard item in most homes.  Already about 70% of the worlds working class use<BR>
<BR>
the internet today. This number isincreasing each and every year.  The internet is <BR>
<BR>
also one of the easiest ways to advertise your products to a mass media.  Unlike <BR>
<BR>
telvision advertising on the internet is always there,where as on TV a commercial <BR>
<BR>
is there for thirty seconds then gone. Probalby the biggest benefit of using the <BR>
<BR>
internet is that you can adverise your product all around the world.<BR>
<BR>
				The weakness of using the internet is that there is a lack of interpersonal <BR>
<BR>
communication between the entrepreuner and the consumer. Presently the biggest <BR>
<BR>
problem might be that everyone does not have a computer or may not even know <BR>
<BR>
how to use the internet if they do own one.  Another possiblity is that people have<BR>
<BR>
to be able to find your page as well, because stumbling onto it is not very likely<BR>
<BR>
    The web is a fascinating tool to be used as a mechanism of delivery, but just as any <BR>
<BR>
product available to society, it has its stregths and weaknesses.		<BR>
