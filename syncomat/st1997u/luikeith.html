<P>Is the web a good tool for instructional delivery? To answer this question,
let's discuss the essence that makes a suitable instructional tool.</P>

<P>To be a suitable tool, the fundamental requirement is that it can present
instructional material effectively and efficiently. It acts as a &quot;virtual
instructor&quot;, so it has to have the capability to deliver lecture material
directly and clearly. </P>

<P>Also, it must be easily accessible to the users. It will be widespread
and accepted only if it can be reached easily, no one would like something
that takes a lot of time and effort only to get in touch with it. </P>

<P>In the early days, audio and video tapes and CD-ROMs were used as tools
for instructional delivery. Many distance learning courses used audio and
video tapes as the major course material. On the tapes, some of them were
prerecorded images of lecture notes or slides with a narrator explaining
the material; while others simply contained its instructor's recorded lectures,
which is a more direct way. CD-ROMs were often used for demonstration and
presentation purposes. They were used by software companies as interactive
user's guides for their software programs. Also, with their large memory
size, they were used as interactive encyclopedia or dictionaries. </P>

<P>The tools discussed above were commonly used for instructional purposes,
but, were they &quot;good&quot; tools? My answer is yes because they process
the essence as good instructional tools. Moreover, the advantage of using
these tools is that there is no time and place constraint. Unlike regular
lectures that students attend classes at a specific time and place, they
can take a course by using these tools at their own convenience. </P>

<P>However, what if a student has questions? As these tools are &quot;read-only&quot;,
students cannot communicate with their instructor solely using the tool
itself, I think this is the biggest drawback. </P>

<P>Since the World Wide Web (WWW) emerged in the 90s, it had became more
developed and its technology has been continuouly enhancing, more and more
tasks and programs can be worked on it. In addition to viewing text and
graphics, which are the most basic functions, with properly installed software
like RealPlayer and Quicktime viewer, audio and video files on the web
can also be played. With these functions, the web can deliver instructional
material effectively and efficiently. For example, lecture slides and notes
can be presented in the form of text and graphics, and the lecture itself
can be taped and stored as audio and video files. </P>

<P>Also, it can be accessed easily. No matter where the user is, all he
needs is a phone line, a modem and a computer to connect to the Internet.
Once a connection is made, he can obtained material from web sites all
over the World. Unlike long distance phone calls, no extra charge is needed
to retrieve &quot;long distance&quot; data. </P>

<P>Moreover, the web provides a solution to the &quot;read-only&quot; disadvantage
of the prior tools - chat rooms. Using chat rooms, students can talk to
their instructor through the web and get immediate answers. </P>

<P>With the advantages mentioned above, it is obvious that the web is a
good tool for instructional delivery. Also, as a new developed instructional
tool, it has the potential to encapsulate all prior tools. As Mr. Kevin
Hughes had said, &quot;Marshall McLuhan wrote that the new media tends
to encapsulate older media. That is, old media can be represented within
the space of media.&quot; For example, the web can be used as a huge multimedia
CD-ROM; it also can be used to watch videos with video files downloaded
from the web, instead of watching video tapes with VCR. </P>

<P>In the near future, the web will continue to be a good tool for insturctional
delivery, and will be the best tool ever. CPS291 is the pioneer in experimenting
the viability of this issue. This is the first course in Virtual University
of MSU (probably the first in the world) to deliver all the course material,
in audio and video formats, over the web. </P>

<P>CPS291 makes use of many of web technologies: Lectures are in RealAudio,
RealVideo and QuickTime file formats, while text and graphics make up the
lecture slides. Instructor and assistants office hours are held in the
chat room, which is enabled by a JAVA program. CGI programs are used to
administer on-line exams and homework, which is called CAPA in MSU. </P>

<P>I took the second half of CPS291 in Hong Kong. All I need were my father's
computer and a phone line to connect to my local server in Hong Kong, I
found it worked as well as I was in the States. I had no problem in viewing
any information or retrieving any data, then I realized that accessiblity
is an absolute advantage of the web over other instructional tools. </P>

<P>CPS291 is a breakthrough in college level education, it demonstrates
an excellent example for instructional delivery through the web. There
are 25 students in this course and I am proud to be one of them. I am looking
forward to take a course on the web using Streaming Virtual Reality in
the future, with all the students wearing complicated goggles and gloves.
