<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the web develops into a more powerful medium,
people are finding many practical ways to use it.&nbsp; In the early days
the web was mostly text oriented. As the technology increased, pictures
and animations were added.&nbsp; Next, sound and video came along.&nbsp;
With all the increases in the abilities of the web, more practical and
useful applications arose.&nbsp; Among them is using the web as an instructional
tool.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Internet was designed to allow people to access
information, and when people have access to information they can learn
from it.&nbsp; The Internet at the very least can be as useful as a book
to instruct people.&nbsp; In fact, it should be better since it is more
easily updated, can have images or animations, and can have sound.&nbsp;
Most people would probably agree that the web could teach a person better
than a book.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can the web be used exclusively to teach a college
level course?&nbsp; This is a bit hard than replacing a book to instruct
a student.&nbsp; People are use to going to class and seeing the professor.
Many would more than likely be apprehensive about even attempting to take
a course over a computer.&nbsp; Realizing this, would the Internet even
have the technical ability to handle the demands of a class?&nbsp; The
answer to this is yes as two classes offered at Michigan State University
demonstrates.&nbsp; CPS 291 and TC 100 are two classes offered over the
Internet.&nbsp; Both courses use web slides and audio to deliver lectures.&nbsp;
Both classes also have similar faults, and advantages over the standard
classroom.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main weakness of both classes is the inablility
to interact with the instructor or other students during a lecture.&nbsp;
Students have to wait to ask a question about a topic they don't understand.&nbsp;
They have the option of email or office hours offered in chat rooms to
get answers, but there can be a substansial delay before receiving help.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the student may not be able to get a grasp of other material,
because they still do not understand the topic prior to it.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another cause of concern over classes on the Internet
is cheating by students.&nbsp; While this will not effect a student who
wants to learn the material of the class from learning it, it may effect
his grade if others are receiving artificially high grades.&nbsp; Also,
it undermines the entire academic institution if cheating is allowed to
continue, but does web based classes allow increased opportunity for cheating
compared to any other course?&nbsp; This depends on how the class is structured.&nbsp;
A student has the ability to cheat just as easily on homework in a web
based class, as a standard class.&nbsp; Online test, however, create a
problem that the typical classroom does not have to worry about.&nbsp;
One student may complete a test and send answers to another.&nbsp; Another
possibility is that a person logs on to take a test but uses text, or notes
that are not allowed.&nbsp; This can be over come by proctoring the exams,
but this hinders one of the greatest advantages of web based courses.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This advantage is the ability of the students to
attend the class at any time, from anywhere.&nbsp; Web based courses are
ideal for students who want to take summer classes, but have to go back
home to work in order to get money for the up coming school year.&nbsp;
With web based classes, students can work with out having to worry about
their employer hassling them about their class schedule.&nbsp; A student
can attend class at hours that normal courses would never be offered at
any university.&nbsp; Also, students can take those classes from their
university and not a community college where students have to worry about
whether the credits will transfer.&nbsp; Also, the grade from a course
at another institution will not count towards a student's GPA at their
university.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing to remember with web based classes
is that as the technology improves, so will the effectiveness of the courses
offered.&nbsp; For example, currently video over the Internet is very limited
in practical uses.&nbsp; The video is very choppy, small, and does not
run well on the typical student's computer.&nbsp; In the future this will
change, and video will become full screen, and interactive.&nbsp; Students
will have the opportunity to ask questions during a lecture and the instructor
can operate the class like a normal one.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Technology like this is still at least a couple of
years away from being available to the average student.&nbsp; Until then
there are other ways to improve web based classes.&nbsp; One way to increase
interaction between students and the instructor is to hold mandatory online
meeting times in chat rooms.&nbsp; Here, not only can the students get
help about topics they do not understand, but the instructor can evaluate
how much students are absorbing the material by asking questions to a student
that they should be able to answer if they are keeping pace with the class.&nbsp;
This may also help discourage cheating by making the students aware that
they will be held responsible for learning the material of the course.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The web can definitely be used successfully as a
tool for instructional delivery as CPS 291 and TC100 both demonstrate.&nbsp;
Courses offered in this way do have strengths over traditional classes,
as well as weaknesses.&nbsp; It is clear that the strengths well out weigh
the disadvantages for many courses.&nbsp; It would not, however, be wise
to offer a calculus course on the Internet at this time, but many courses
can be effectively taught via computer.&nbsp; As time progresses so well
technology pertaining to the Internet, and classes over the net will become
even more practical.
