Delivery</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>The main question posed to us for this term paper in CPS 291 was: &quot;Is
instructional delivery via the web possible?&quot;</P>

<P>I don't think that anyone could have spent fifteen weeks in a virtual
course and answer this question with a negative answer. Furthermore, I think that everyone can see that with the way
technology is progressing many activities are electronic or automated. Instruction via the web and especially entirely
dedicated to the teachings of the web is a very beneficial course for anyone to take--no matter what their computer
skills. 
<P>Virtual classrooms encompass benefits for many users. In today's competitive
market, many business peopleneed to practice and add to their skills. This proves to be a difficult
task for the working individual unless they take advantages of seminars in the workplace, which often are simplistic
and unchallenging. 
<P>There are many benefits to having classes on the web. In the workplace
these benefits are many. Employeed individuals can work on their degrees without having to compromise their
current work environment. Individuals can attend the class in a more leisurely manner relative to time constraints
while still being able to balance the stresses of work and home life. The ability to download course material and make
a hard copy allows the individual to follow the lecture and make notes along with the discussion. The ability to pause
and replay a lecture allows the individual to fully take in what is being presented at their own pace and retention rate.
Another very important feature is that you are allowed to work at your own rate. Individuals can spend more time with
the material that is most difficult for them and move more rapidly through material which they gain a strong grasp on.
For students especially, there are academic advantages. A student could
attend more classes because you can take a day's classes and work in a virtual setting during some of the
more irregular schooling hours. This technology could allow more students to graduate in four years due to the number
of courses which currently overlap in a semester. 

<P>These overlapping courses make it necessary for a student to &quot;choose&quot;
one over another, and sometimes lengthing their college duration.
<P>There are some items which people could deem as disadvantages for a
virtual course. There is a lack of personal  interaction between student and professor/peers. This could be a problem
especially during the more challenging portions of the course materials. CPS&nbsp;291 uses chat room and e-mail
to try to remedy the lack of personalization, however, some people just need to have closer contact to gain a full
understanding. One of the main disadvantages, or problems one might encounter is the malfuntion of hardware or software
while enrolled in the course. This could cause pure chaos (I have personal experience with this one!) If you do encounter
system problems you could be deserted in cyberspace until you can regain access. This could affect your grade
by missing deadlines. The CAPA system is a perfect example, if you miss the deadline it does not let you in to
catch up!
<P>Some specific changes which might be helpful for CPS 291 in particular
are: Update course syllabus when changes are made in deadlines and/or assignments. It would also be really
useful for reinforcement purposes if there were more notes accompanying the lecture slides. After exams and homework,
it would have been nice to know what  the correct answers should have been to the questions. 
<P>The future of virtual classes is alive! I can see many companies having
on-line seminars. This would cut down on the cost of a consulting firm or trainers. The virtual classroom would
be beneficial for world-wide corportations allowing individuals to attend without the high cost of transportation. For college
campuses, this would cut down the cost of instructors needed thus hopefully cutting tuition (once the virtual
class is in place and operating at maximum optimization.)
<P>As a side note, I was also part of the pioneering class in 1992 at Michigan
State University for IAH 201. Their new idea then was to use instructional TV for the course which made
the course more uniform. The lectures were taped and each section had a teaching assistant. I must say that CPS 291 was
much more educational and more interesting because it was all a &quot;hands on&quot; type of course. CPS 291 was
a great course and I&nbsp;hope many more people get the 
opportunity to attend. </P>
