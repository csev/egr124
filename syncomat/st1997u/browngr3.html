<font size=+3>The Use of the Internet for Instructional Delivery in a University Setting</font>
</center>
<P>
The prevalence of Internet access in many homes and in most universities has opened new opportunities for the delivery of instructional materials.  This means of conveying information has several advantages over the standard lecture format of university classes.  However, there are new disadvantages that arise from using this technology.
<P>
The chief advantage of using the Internet as a means to distribute instructional materials is convenience.  A student enrolled in a class delivered over the Internet can retrieve and view the information for the class at any time of the day or night.  This gives the student more flexibility in his schedule.  A class delivered electronically over the Internet can give a student the key he needs to piece together a schedule that allows him to complete his required courses in a timely fashion.
<P>
This flexibility, however, can become a disadvantage. If a student is already busy, it takes a great amount of self-motivation to download the lecture and view it at a computer screen. When no specific time is established for regular lectures, it becomes too easy to procrastinate.  The students who care about getting a good grade would rush through the lectures before the exam and forget all they "learned" after the exam.  In this scenario, Internet-delivered instruction would not be effective.
<P>

The advantage of convenience does not exist for the professor, however.  He must still prepare lectures and materials.  In fact, there is an added burden for the professor. The professor must take the time to learn how to record his lecture and make  computer-readable drawings and diagrams.  For some, this may not be a problem at all, but, there are those individuals who do not want anything to do with technology.
<P>
But, once the professor has learned to do this, he can utilize media that may not be available in an average classroom.  A professor may wish to develop a HyperStudio presentation for a particular subject.  Another use the professor could make of this is a library for a particular class.  A professor could use each class to develop material for the next class' instruction, which could be kept in an online archive.  He could collect his own curriculum and materials online, rather than wait for publishers to print the books.  This would make those materials available in a more timely fashion.  
<P>
Another advantage for the student is that the instructional material is transferred electronically and can be stored on each student's disk. Therefore each student can have a record of each lecture.  The instructional material can be viewed and reviewed by each student at his own pace.  A student can use this to study for exams or review older material with the original lecture.  A student can acheive greater comprehension of the material presented in lecture with electronic versions of the lecture.  Rather than miss half of a lecture, a student can stop the lecture and review the concept they missed as many times as needed.  
<P>
While the electronically stored lecture can aid a student in review, the student may have a problem with comprehension and retention of the material.  In a traditional class, students must take notes to remember what the professor has said.  However, with Internet-delivered classes, the entire lecture is given to the student in electronic form.  This reduces his motivation to take notes, even though it is know that writing increases retention over just listening.  Only the most motivated students would feel the need to take notes on important concepts.  Perhaps all should be encouraged to take notes on the lectures as if they would in an average class.
<P>
Assuming that the homework for an Internet-delivered class would also be over the Internet, means that retention is an even greater challenge.  A person could listen to the lecture and do the online homework in the matter of a few hours.  The person would not need to remember the facts to be tested, either.  He can switch back and forth between the lecture and the homework as he does the homework.  A person could even do the homework as he listens to the lecture for the first time.  
<P>
Clearly, if they are not really learning the material, this is not the best scenario.  Perhaps, one or two short essay questions per homework assignment would be a possible remedy to this situation.  Another possibility could be assigning small projects or papers on the concepts just discussed in lecture.  Perhaps teaching assistants should be used to run an online forum, or chat area, where each student must take a short quiz each week, as in some lab sections of average classes.  While these measures would force the students to stay up to date with the lectures, this requires more work for the professor. The professor should not have to spoon-feed the students.  They are adults and should be responsible enough to be sure they understand the material presented in each lecture.

<P>
Another downside of the electronically delivered lecture, for both student and professor, is that there is no interaction between the professor and the students.  Each student is alone with his computer rather than in a room with the professor and other students who are trying to understand the same material. No brave students would be present to ask the professor to re-explain a key concept or to define unknown symbols.  The professor would not be able to read the faces of his students and adjust the lecture on the fly accordingly.
<P>
The person-to-person interaction available in a traditional setting can be replaced by email and electronic forums in an Internet-delivered class. Email can provide (somewhat) private communications between two members of the class or between the professor and students.  An online forum can allow groups of students or students and the professor to discuss the concept and digress from it in real time.  
Using email and an online forum would only work if the students, professor, and teaching assistants read their email and visited the online forums.  As with listening to or watching the lectures, this can be hindered by procrastination on anyone's part. 
<P>
A possible downside to Internet-delivered classes would be the fear held by the technologically-challenged.  This class, CPS 291, has a good online resources area started that would be needed as a companion for Internet-delivered classes.  This area would help those people who might be too afraid or too ignorant to set up their computer appropriately.  
<P>
Internet-delivered classes can be a great help to people who need the added convenience.  When done right, an Internet-delivered class can be a useful addition to the university setting.  However, these classes leave a great deal of room for procrastination and sloppiness.  Motivated students and professors are needed to make this work effectively and smoothly.
