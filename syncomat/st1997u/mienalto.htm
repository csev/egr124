<P>Today's world is a hectic one - full of jobs, appointments, and events.  For students, there is the added stress that comes from a full schedule of classes and homework.  Many students usually find themselves saying: "Where did all my time go?" or "When am I going to get this done?"  A novel solution to this common dilemma is the Internet.  If properly initialized by the professor and properly utilized by the student, this innovation in communication could provide an adequate virtual classroom that will save time for everyone involved.</P>

<P>Currently one may occasionally come across a class web site.  This site is usually a supplement to the class, an option available to those students who use the Internet more regularly.  Usually one can find class notes, practice questions, homework, or an area to ask questions.  Some examples of this may be found on Michigan State University's <A HREF="//www.cem.msu.edu/course_pages.html">Chemistry Course Pages</A>.  These sites are usually useful, but the students must still go to the lectures, the recitations, and the office hours at certain scheduled times for <I>direct</I> help.  In other words, these sites are helpful but they only offer limited assistance to students.  These sites cannot be used to operate and maintain a class.  The operation of a course that is successfully taught on the Internet requires more complex care.  These sites must offer more than just homework, notes, and practice questions; they must also offer lectures and direct help - the keys to teaching students.</P>

<P>At this point, the creation of a course site for a virtual classroom is not easy to do.  This will change, however, as more courses are taught on the Internet.  Newer virtual courses can use the older courses as models and make the necessary modifications.  Obviously each type of course (i.e., Arts and Humanities, Natural Sciences, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, Computer Sciences, etc.) will base its virtual course and the most appropriate format.  For instance, a class studying operas will probably use video files and sound files more often, and a literature course will probably include a great deal of text and a few picture formats.  Moreover, a Computer Science course is probably the most likely to use all forms of media since:
<ul>
<li>It ultimately involves the study of the Internet.
<li>There are many formats that are best seen in pictures and photos.
<li>-Video files could be used for subjects from displaying hardware installation to video conferencing.
</ul>
No matter which course, all these files must be efficiently coordinated so that they are quickly displayed, easily accessed by those with the authorization to access them, and in terms that are appropriate for the class (not too simple but not too complicated).  In addition, the proper plug-ins will be needed for the class to utilize many of the new Internet technologies.  In short, virtual classroom designers must take into account every aspect of computer literacy and technology for a course to "healthily" exist on the Internet.  This paper will elaborate on how to build a successful virtual course on the Internet by using CPS 291 as an example.</P>

<P><A HREF="//www.vu.msu.edu/preview/cps291/">CPS 291: Introduction to the Internet</A> is the perfect course for what Michigan State University calls its "Virtual University."  This course teaches basic information on <A HREF="//www.vu.msu.edu/preview/cps291/lectures/histnew/">Internet history</A>, Internet tools, HTML, businesses use of the Internet, as well as technical aspects of the Internet.  The course is entirely operated on the Internet; this includes lectures, notes, office hours, information and message boards, homework, and helpful references.  Currently the course is going well, but things can and will be better.  It is being extensively developed for improved use in the upcoming years, and it will be one of the university's first completely virtual courses.</P>

<P>Lectures for this model site are available in video through <A HREF="//www.real.com">Real Player</A> and in audio through <A HREF="//www.real.com">Real Audio</A>.  The video works well with the newer, more powerful Pentium (+) computers, and the audio works well with the older 486 model, as far as PCs go.  The only problem with these "Real" sources is the bandwidth.  In the future, all students using the "Virtual University" should have at least a 28.8 modem.  Slower modems simply do not provide enough bandwidth to see or hear the lectures.  Moreover, the computers must have enough RAM to handle multiple programs simultaneously or to be able to download the lecture for later use.  This format is very convenient for those students who cannot always attend classes at traditional times or who are off campus.  In the future, however, the use of video conferencing into a virtual classroom setting does seem plausible.  In this certain sections of this course, the professor, live through conferencing, could give lectures, show examples, and even field questions.  While this may be helpful for those who are off-campus, the students who cannot attend class at traditional times may register for another section that does not utilize such video conferencing for lectures.  Just by studying the various lecture formats, one may see the potential of such a class, both locally and globally.</P>

<P>Notes are available for viewing or downloading on the Internet.  Now they are formatted in a PowerPoint format, but perhaps in the future full text versions of the notes could be made available for download over the Internet as well.  With the proper modem, one may read the notes and listen or watch the lecture at the same time.  Perhaps in the future, the text for the notes may be added to the video as a translucent text display at the bottom of the view screen so that the text may be seen without looking from left to right at the notes and the video.</P>

<P>The information and message boards work very well.  Similar to most boards, questions may be posted for the professor or teaching assistants (TAs), and general information and announcements may be posted.  The format now does not necessarily need to be changed.  It could be improved by allowing the students to add areas of discussion, instead of using one or two general discussion and feedback message boards.  Moreover, new boards for each new subject in the course may help those only interested in one of the subjects.</P>

<P>Homework is easily handled by Michigan State University's <A HREF="//capa2.msu.edu/class.html">CAPA (Computer Assisted Personalized Approach) system</A>.  This useful system is already set up for courses from chemistry and physics to communications.  Most students at Michigan State University are introduced to this system within the first year of classes.  Furthermore, this system encourages the use of the computer; lets students know how well they are doing as they answer questions; and in Internet format with MS Windows, allows for multiple browser windows so that the Internet may be used while answering questions.  CAPA is also currently being used for exams.  This is suitable for open-book exams, but it does allow students more freedom to cheat.  Perhaps in the future, voice patterns and cameras may be utilized to prevent cheating; however, the traditional testing methods may be more dependable.  Those who are on-campus could be given times to choose from to take the test in monitored computer labs, and those off-campus would need a witness's signature that no cheating occurred.  Perhaps a more practical way to test comprehension, the use of extensive homework and small projects published in student's web home directory could be implemented.  Some possible projects could include building a resume online, making a personal home page, making a model business home page, and publishing essays (like this one).  There are actually many opportunities available for evaluating students.</P>

<P>One final area that needs much attention in the creation of an ideal virtual class is the chat room.  Chat rooms may be used for professor and TA office hours, review sessions, post-exam question and answer sessions, group studying, and other general meetings.  This chat room, like most of the "cps291.vu.msu.edu" site is only available to those who can provide the correct authorization passwords.  Unfortunately, these passwords are necessary to prevent outsiders from infiltrating and using the chat room for reasons other than the CPS 291 class.  Perhaps in the future these chat rooms will also include video conferencing so that videos or still photos of those in a conversation will be obtainable.  Currently most review sessions are optional.  In the upcoming years, there should be a few mandatory review sessions.  This would help the professor and TAs "meet" the students for assessment of the student's computer literacy, course progress, and his or her spontaneous feedback on course materials.</P>

<P>Office hours are also conducted in the chat rooms.  Currently they receive little attendance by students, which may mean that improvements need to be made to the office hours.  For example, joint TA office hours could be held so students can easily "hear" what two or more TAs have to "say."  The times of these help hours should be convenient for all students (and TAs) to ensure all students the chance to ask questions.  An alternative to office hours is the use of meetings two or three times per week; however, these meetings offer less of a chance to ask questions and must be tested before use.  The current chat room is an <A HREF="//www.vu.msu.edu/preview/cps291/chat.html">EWGIE</A> room, which uses JAVAscript; thus, all students should have a high quality JAVA-supporting browser (<A HREF="//www.netscape.com">Netscape</A> 3.0 w/JAVA or <A HREF="//www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</A> Internet Explorer 3.0).  Future chat rooms with web sites may require browsers that are compatible with such real time video viewers that will allow for video conferencing.  Although chat room attendance is usually low, it is perhaps the best use of Internet technology to date.  As enrollment for this course increases or if the class becomes worth more credits, attendance will also increase.</P>

<P>In conclusion, the virtual course is a viable teaching alternative that should and will be available more commonly in the future.  Currently courses such as Michigan State University's CPS 291 are charting new waters by introducing the virtual classroom to the world.  They extend so-called course pages to give students a fully functional and convenient learning method.  Perhaps more important, these courses will only improve as computer technology progresses, thus making the Internet a very powerful educational tool.</P>
