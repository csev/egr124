<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the beginning of formalized schooling, teachers
have tried to incorporate new technologies into learning. From simple tools
like slide projectors and calculators to the newest items such as computers.
The most advanced and emerging teaching tool is the internet. While many
teachers use it to give students access to information, some instructors
are using it as a virtual classroom. The introduction of such a new medium
leads to questions of the positive and negative aspects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are many benefits to this type of instruction. The
wide access to the internet now prevalent would perhaps allow more students
to take a course. Computer Science 291 is an excellent example. A centralized
class is presented and people from around Michigan and the world are able
to access the information and study the material. I have benefited from
this myself. Since I spend my summers in Holland, two hours from the classrooms
of Michigan State, I would not be able to take a course like this unless
it were offered on the internet. This also leads to the ability to choose
from where one logs onto the classroom. If a student is on vacation in
a traditional class they would miss the class and have to obtain notes
from another student. If a student is on vacation in the internet based
course, they may be able to access the information and keep up with the
class. Overall, a major benefit of internet based teaching is the flexibility
of location.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The flexibility to scheduling is another benefit of this
medium of teaching. The students have greater ability to decide when to
access information and lectures. Usually a class is offered two to three
times a week, at a set time. An internet based course can be accessed any
time of the day or night. If a student has to work during the day, the
materials will be available after they finish. Also, a student can work
at their own pace, repeating lectures and going over material until they
are sure they understand it. This may help students who have experienced
professors who lecture too quickly!</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another benefit of web based teaching is the professor’s
ability to ensure complete and uniform delivery of his or her message.
In a large or small traditional lecture, a teacher’s message could be interpreted
many different ways. Sometimes what one person hears is not the same message
or information another person hears. The internet based teaching allows
the teachers to pin point what they feel are the important items. It also
allows them to ensure that the message presented is the same for everyone.
This message would also be available for change and update as the information
changes. Many of the classes offered online are technical in nature. Since
the technical fields are rapidly evolving, information may be outdated
from day to day. The ability to alter information quickly and easily is
a definite benefit! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While there are many benefits of internet based teaching,
there are also negative points as well. There is an obvious lack of human
contact. In a traditional teaching classroom, the professor is available
right away. While on the internet a teacher may take a little longer to
reach by email or phone. Students may also have trouble picking up certain
items and not be able to ask questions immediately, with immediate feedback.
While there are others, I personally think this is the most prevalent and
obvious. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Overall, I think that internet based teaching is a terrific
way to offer a course. I really have benefited from my classes on the internet
and think that other students have as well. It really is the newest, most
innovative way to learn! </FONT></P>
