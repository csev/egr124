v1.3.0.0
---------------------------- Shareware Alert ! -------------------------------

The trial version of this program has a 30-day trial period. After the 30-days
is up, an annoyance screen will appear each time the program is launched. This
program took a lot of effort, I'd appreciate a little cash so that I can buy a
new desk. Sorry for the annoyance screen.

To register this program and eliminate all of the annoying pop-up screens, you 
will need $10 US. Send me email and I will tell you what to do.

--------------------------- Instructions -------------------------------------

This program may be run normally from Win95/NT by creating a shortcut to it,
or by running from the Start menu.

This program can be used to convert files from one image format to another, by
specifiying an otuput size that is larger than the input size. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run from a DOS prompt in 95/NT :

START /W THUMB [/HIDE] <INDIR> <OUTDIR> <OUT MAX X> <OUT MAX Y> [OUTFILE TYPE]

"START /W" forces the DOS box to wait until ThumbNailer has exited before 
returning the cursor.

/HIDE forces the app to run silently - no windows are launched.
Without /HIDE, the app runs as a normal Windows app and all other parameters 
are ignored.

<OUTDIR>  specifies directory to which files will be written      ** mandatory
<OUT MAX X, Y>    maximum dimensions of output files.             ** mandatory
